**General Exploration Challenges**

An exploration challenge begins by selecting one or two knowledge or perception characteristics and announcing what questions you are going to ask of the GM.  For example, if you come across ancient runes, you might use _knowledge of writing_ to ask "What do the runes say?" and _knowledge of local history_ to ask "Who wrote them?" and "When were they written?"

The player then rolls dice equal to the unit's Integrity score and assigns them to the characteristics, starting with 6s for the first characteristic and working down.  Players can choose to reroll dice as per the challenge process, but note that a die can only be assigned _up_ on a reroll but not _down_ - for example, a 3 can be rerolled to a 4, 5 or 6, but not as a 1 or 2.

Players can ask one question per die assigned to the chosen characteristics, starting with the questions that they planned ahead of time.
