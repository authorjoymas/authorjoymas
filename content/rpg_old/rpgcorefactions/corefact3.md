### Legacy Unit

The first thing to do when creating a faction is to create a legacy unit.  This unit represents the pinnacle of your faction, and could a major city or region if playing on an epic scale, a large army or a village, a sortie, or even an individual, depending on your campaign and focus.  Your legacy unit will have an Integrity score of 10, but otherwise it all the other properties - size, motivations, weaknesses and characteristics - are up to you.

### Creating History

Once your legacy unit is created, you are potentially ready to begin the game, but it may be worthwhile going through a phase of _creating history_.  This phase occurs before a game or campaign starts, and players don't need to take turns.  In this phase players can detach units from and attach units to their legacy unit.  Because all the new units are derived from a single source, there is a thematic and iterative connection linking them together.
