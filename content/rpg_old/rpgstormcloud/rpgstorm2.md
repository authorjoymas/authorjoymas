The Roaming Stormclouds are a scattered empire that inhabit mountain passes, valleys and foothills.  Their villages are typically hidden away from main trade routes, and they rarely appear on any imperial maps.  They have no major cities, and though their villages are small they are quite numerous.  The Stormclouds have many mountain-top shrines and temples who survive in part on regular pilgrimages to bring food.

The Stormclouds have a decentralised political system, with representatives from villages joining the _Roaming Clouds_, a travelling democratic assembly with an elected leader, which also acts as a tax-collection body, merchant caravan, and sometimes as a standing army.  Rather than being situated in one place, the Roaming Clouds moves from village to village and visits the various parts of their domain, giving outsiders the impression that the culture is nomadic.

During times of war and crisis, the Roaming Clouds are known as the Roaming Stormclouds, the size of the standing army is increased, and scout parties investigate and sometime raid border villages.
