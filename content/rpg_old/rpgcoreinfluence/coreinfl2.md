An influence challenge occurs when a player tries to make another unit do what the player wants - for example, asking a temple for a favour, seducing a princess, intimidating an army to flee, or recruiting troops.

In an influence challenge, the player needs to _make an argument_ that compels the other unit to do what the player wants.  An argument has several steps:

**A premise**

A premise is a foundation on which an argument is built.  It can either be something true, or it can be a compelling lie.  In order to tell the truth, the player should have a characteristic with the relevant knowledge - for example, if discussing temple politics, the player should have _knowledge of the temple_.  In order to tell a compelling lie, the player should have a characteristic that suggests they are good at _creativity_ or _deception_, or even _charm_.  If the target unit has knowledge of the right area, however, they might see through the lie.

Premises include statements such as, "An army is coming", "The temple is running out of money", "A ghost is haunting the palace", or "We have lots of silk to trade".


**An implication**

The statement should then lead to an implication - some consequence of the statement being true that will affect the listener - for example: "The army will overrun the city", "The temple won't be able to influence the monarch", "The ghost will possess the monarch", or "You can sell the silk for a profit."

**An appeal**

An appeal connects the implication to the target unit's motivation - for example, the army will remove the _peace_, the lack of money will affect their _power_, a threat to the monarch might spur their _loyalty_, or the sale of silk might appeal to their desire for _wealth_.

**An exhortation**

The exhortation is where the player describes their instructions to the other unit which, if their influence is successful, will be carried out.

"Bandits have taken over Green Wake Forest.

"They will stop shipments of food coming through.

"The _welfare of the village_ will be harmed.

"You should come with us and help drive them away."
