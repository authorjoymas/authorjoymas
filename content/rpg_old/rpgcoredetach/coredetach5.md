### Attachments

As well as _detachments_, units can also be created as _attachments_.  An attachment is a unit that is part of another, bigger unit.  For example, an army might include a specialist Palatine Guard, or a delegation might include a High Priestess and her retinue, or a city might contain a guild.  An attachment has its own Integrity score, motivations, weaknesses and characteristics.  However, unlike a detachment, which is a fully independent unit that can stray far away from the main unit it came from, attachments move with and act with the main unit at all times.

Attachments allow a main unit to have more character, definition and variety.  A player may be satisfied with "an army" as their unit, and march them across the country-side to siege an enemy fortress, or they may wish to have an army composed of archers, spears, and swords.  A player might find "a city" sufficient to conduct trade and diplomacy and raise armies, or they may want to have a bustling city with guilds, palaces and guards.  If a player wants more detail, they can create attachments that live inside the main unit.  If a player wants their city to have layers of detail, they can create attachments inside attachments inside attachments!  There is no theoretical limit to the number or depth of attachments except the paperwork and mental struggle involved.

An attachment is created through the same process as a detachment, except that it never leaves the main unit - the main unit is selected, the player makes a plan, and rolls and re-rolls.  However, because the attachment does not leave the main unit, an attachment with a higher Integrity score than the main unit will _not_ reduce the Integrity score of the main unit.

When using a unit that has attachments, the player can choose whether to initiate or respond to a challenge using the properties of the main unit or using the properties of the attachment, with the consequences affecting the attached unit.

If the attached unit takes damage to its Integrity, the main takes damage to its Integrity as well.  If the attachment has less Integrity than the main unit, it will disband before the main unit does.  If it has more Integrity, the attached unit will beome an independent unit when the main unit disbands.
