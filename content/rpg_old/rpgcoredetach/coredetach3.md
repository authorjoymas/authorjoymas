### Select the main unit

First, select the main unit you want to make a detachment from, such as a town, city, army, sortie, or even a small band of friends.  Pick a characteristic from that unit - for example, if you are detaching a delegation from a city, the city might have a _diplomatic_ or _respected_ characteristic that you can choose.  Alternatively, if you are detaching a raiding party from an army, the army might have a _quick-footed_ characteristic you can choose.  The characteristic doesn't need to top-listed characteristic of the main unit.  This characteristic is going to be the top characteristic of the detached unit.

The detached unit is going to inherit an Integrity score based upon the listed order of the chosen characteristic.  For example, if the chosen characteristic is the top listed, the detached unit would have an Integrity score of 6, and if it were the second-listed it would have an Integrity score of 5, and so on.

### Make a plan

Describe what you want your detached unit to be like - its motivations, weakness, characteristics, and additional Integrity score.  Each of these planned features will depend on a successful dice roll.

The top-listed characteristic is inherited from the main unit automatically, and doesn't require a dice roll.  Similarly, the size of the new unit must be smaller than that of the main unit, but doesn't require a roll of the dice to define.
