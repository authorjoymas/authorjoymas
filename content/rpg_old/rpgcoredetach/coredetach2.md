_All the Rivers and Mountains_ allows players to detach smaller units from bigger units so that players can move smoothly from large-scale action and drama to small-scale action and drama.  For example, a player might detach a group of assassins from a larger army, a diplomatic delegation from a city, or a hunting party from a village.  The newly detached unit is created from a main unit by a process decribed below - however, once the process is finished, it is a fully-functional unit in its own right.

Detachment occurs when a player wants to detach part of a unit (the _detached_ unit) from another unit (the _main_ unit).  To detach a unit, the player must first select the main unit, decide which characteristic is going to be the primary characteristic of the detached unit, and then roll and re-roll to customise the newly detached unit.
