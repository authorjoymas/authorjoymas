### Attachments as items and more

Another use of attachments is to create items.  In _All the Rivers and Mountains_, while players can play as enormous faction, they can also play as individual characters, such as heroic soldiers or powerful and mystical priests.  Attached items allow players to customise individual characters to a greater degree.  Attached items also allows dedicated players to fully equip their armies and delegations, down to armour, weapons, rucksacks, clothing and more.

The biggest difference between attachments as units-within-units and as items, is that if the character carrying the items dies, the items do not become independent units that can wander about on their own.  Otherwise, the same rules of attachments apply - the player can choose to use attachments instead of the main unit, but the main unit takes damage when the attachment does.

In addition to items, attachments could also be mental states, fighting styles, spiritual parasites, memories or a variety of other aspects of a character that could be part of the character of the unit.

### Crafting

As well as making smaller units from bigger units, attachments can be made from things in the environment.  In essence, every part of the environment can be considered a unit with its own characteristics - a rock might be _durable_ and _heavy_, or a tree branch might be _long_ and _flexible_.  A player can attempt to control these environmental units using the _navigate_ challenge (see the [challenges](/rpgcoretest.html) section).  Once they control that unit - that is, they have mastery over the rocks, metals, animals, rivers, or the like - they can then use the attachment process to create an item.  The primary characteristic of the item must be one of the listed characteristics of the part of nature.
