### Roll

Next, roll a number of dice equal to the Integrity score of the main unit, and line them up next to the main unit's characteristics like a challenge roll.  Each die assigned to the chosen characteristic for the detached unit will add to the success of that unit.  You can re-roll one die from each row beneath the relevant characteristic, just like in a challenge roll.

Each dice assigned to the relevant characteristic is a success, and completes part of the plan.  For example, if the player rolls four successful dice, they could apply four of their desired characteristics, or three of their desired characteristics plus their desired motivation, or two characteristics, and 2 additional points of Integrity.

If the roll doesn't have enough successes to completely design the detached unit, the GM can design or negotiate the rest of the unit, _or_ the player can sacrifice an Integrity point of the newly detached unit to define extra features.

### Integrity Cost

If the newly detached unit has an Integrity score equal to or greater than that of the main unit, the main unit will lose an Integrity point.  This represents that a major part of the main unit has been moved to the detachment.

### Re-attachment and re-detachment

Any unit can be absorbed into a bigger unit once the player is done with it - when the raiding party returns home, the scouting party returns to the main host, or the delegation arrives back at the palace.  The player might not want to keep so many units in their mind all at once, and they can be safely retired.

To re-attach a unit, simply declare it so, and the smaller unit will disappear.  If the smaller unit had a bigger Integrity score than the bigger unit, the bigger unit gains 1 Integrity.

If, later, the player wants to detach the same smaller unit again, they need not go through the process of rolling.  They can simply return the detached unit to the game in the state that it left.
