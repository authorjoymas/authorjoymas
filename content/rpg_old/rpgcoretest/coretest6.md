### Responding to challenges

While it will often be the players who instigate challenges, sometimes the GM will instigate a challenge against the players, representing another faction, unit or the environment encountering the players' units.

When this occurs, the GM will announce the plan of the opposing unit (or environment), as well as which characteristic of the player's unit is being challenged.  The player will roll dice as if it were an ordinary challenge, and assign them to the characteristics of their unit.  Each die that is assigned to the challenged characteristic defends against some part of the opponent's plan.  Players can also re-roll one die from each row beneath the relevant characteristic.
