### How does it work?

The file has several sheets.  The first three take user input, and the remaining sheets are a nightmarish collection of cobbled together stuff that usually does what I want it to.

### Input Sheet

This sheet has a few parts.  Up the top, in the white box, is where you can put in an _input word_.  This is the seed that will generate your output.  Each time you put in the same seed word, you will get the same output word.

The next five yellow boxes are the _output_.  Once you put in an input word, they will spit out some output.  Each box has a label (chosen on a different page) for your language name, followed by three suggestion-words underneath.  Each language will apply it own set of sound changes to the generated word.  You can configure these sound changes on a separate page (the Sound Change Sheet).  (If you are wondering why the last three in this screenshot look the same, it is because I was too lazy to put in the sound changes for each language.)

Underneath this is another input box and another set of output boxes.  This input box is for _conwords_ - words from your constructed language.  The conword will then have the different sound changes applied so you can see how an ancestor word might evolve into descendent words.  (For example, Latin _caput_ became Italian _capo_ and French _chef_.  You are putting in the "Latin" word and getting the "French" and "Italian" words out.)
