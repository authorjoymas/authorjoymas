### What is this?

This is an excel spreadsheet that I have hacked together as a personal tool to help me generate words for a constructed language.

The sheet takes any word (or any string of letters) as input, and spits out three options for a _conword_, a constructed language word.  The sheet allows you to choose the phonotactics of the words, as well as various sound changes for up to five languages, so that your words will hopefully sound like you want them to, and as if they all come from the same language.

Rather than randomly generating words each time the sheet it used, it uses the input word as a seed.  This means that putting in the same input word will always produce the same output conword.  For example, each time you input _fire_ the sheet will spit out the same conword.  In this sense, I think it acts a little like a dictionary - you can always go back and check what word-suggestions it gave you for your input, without you having to remember and record each individual word that is has generated.

### Why use it?

If you are making fantasy names for a culture, you might want all those names to sound like they come from the one culture.  To do this, an effective way is to choose the phonotactics of the  language your fantasy culture uses.  _Phonotactics_ essentially means the sounds that are in the language (as different languages have different collections of sounds) and the way those sounds are allowed, or not allowed, to be put together.  This sheet helps produce words with consistent phonotactics that you develop yourself.

###  Does it work?

A little.  I made it myself in excel with my limited powers.  It does roughly what I want it to, though it does break sometimes.  I bet it could be optimised, but for the life of me I have no idea what I'm doing and how to make it better.  Feel free to improve upon it.
