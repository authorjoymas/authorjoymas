### The underbelly - Oct 4, 2023

I don't know if the Yes vote or the No vote will get up, but the discussion so far has revealed a lot to me about some of the people we share this country with - people who lack empathy, who are happy to subjugate others, who are happy to be hypocrites as long as they get what they want, and who prefer violence over democracy.

If we vote No, we'll be sending these people a message that their positions are supported.  These people will show up more and more often.  You might have seen a greater presence of neo-Nazis and anti-queer rhetoric, and this isn't a coincidence.  These people share a way of thinking, and it would be a powerful message to tell them that they're wrong.
