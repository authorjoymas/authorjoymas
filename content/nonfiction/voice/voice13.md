### Fairness and Equality, Oct 12, 2023

When the original colonies got together to form the Federation, the less populous colonies like Tasmania were worried about being dictated to by the more populous colonies.  Complete electoral equality can lead to something called "the tyranny of the majority" where minorities of all sorts don't get much of a say, if at all, even though they have important interests and issues.

The compromise was for smaller states to have more representation than was proportional to their population - a principle that persists today.  This is the idea of preferring fairness over strict equality.  This preference for fairness has been present in our Constitution since it was created.

It's been a principle since the inception of Australia to design the Constitution to prefer fairness for minority populations over rigid electoral equality that can cause minorities disadvantage.  Initially this principle was applied just to British colonies, but we have the chance now to extend it to the original political communities that were here before the British.

Adding a Voice won't undermine the fundamental design considerations of the Constitution - it's quite in line with them.
