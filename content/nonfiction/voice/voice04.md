### Empathy and deliberation - Sept 17, 2023

The fundamental qualities of democracy are empathy and deliberation.

Equal voting power and elected representatives, while good ideas, only really work when the representatives genuinely try to understand the lives of their constituents and have honest, good-faith discussions with other representatives about policy.

The institutions of our democracy shouldn't prioritise an abstract sense of political equality over empathy and deliberation.  The Voice to Parliament would be a beneficial complement to our existing institutions and consistent with the principles of a healthy democracy.  It will help some without hurting others.  That's the sort of thing I want to see in our democracy.

Putting the Voice in the Constitution will send a strong signal that this isn't about short-term party politics, but a belief about the type of democracy we want to be - not one about legal technicalities but about talking and listening (something that I think US politics has forgotten, where people constantly try to exploit procedures for their own gain).

Let's be an innovative, empathetic and deliberative democracy.
