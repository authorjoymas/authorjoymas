### What the Voice will do - Oct 5, 2023

What sort of issues will the Voice engage with?

We've already got a government that represents the people, so there's some discussion about why we need a special Voice for First Nations peoples.  There are several main reasons.

First, the Australian government has a history of policies that specifically target First Nations peoples negatively, such as the basics card, the Stolen Generations, or the Northern Territory Intervention.  No other group of Australians has had such consistent and specific maltreatment from the government.  This often happens when people in government see First Nations peoples as the problem.  A Voice will help prevent such punitive policies, and identify the best way to understand the problems First Nations peoples face.

Second, good policy goals can fail if they're not a good match for the customs and culture of the people they're trying to help.  First Nations culture is quite diverse and one-size-fits-all policies might not be able to deliver services effectively.  A Voice can help find solutions by ensuring First Nations cultures are considered in policy design.
Third, First Nations peoples are sometimes singled out by groups such as the police, so that even fair laws are implemented unfairly.  A Voice will ensure that this type of issue is not ignored.

Finally, First Nations peoples have a variety of issues that don't apply to other Australians, especially to do with traditional lands and customs, the impacts of British invasion, and concepts of sovereignty.

Australia is unique: it has a unique history, faces unique challenges and needs to have a unique variant of democracy to address them.
