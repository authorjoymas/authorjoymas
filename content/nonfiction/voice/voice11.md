### Lack of details - Oct 7, 2023

So why aren't there more details about what the Voice will look like?  Won't that mean that it might be able to stop or slow down how the government makes laws?

There's three main areas to think about here: the powers of the Voice, the resources it will have, and how people are selected to be part of it.

There's actually a lot of details about the powers, which are very limited.  The wording of the amendment will give it the power to "make representations". If you're wondering why the wording doesn't use the term "advice", that's because the term "advice" in Constitutional documents means the person receiving the advice is compelled to follow it. So they've chosen wording that means the Voice can't compel Parliament.

The Constitution also outlines what powers the Voice can't have.  According to the Constitution, only the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Queen (read "King and Governor-General") can have legislative power.  The Voice constitutionally can't have that power, so it can't initiate, vote on, amend, veto or delay legislation.  The Constitution also allows the Parliament to act on its own, so it doesn't have to wait for the Voice's advice on a policy if it doesn't want to.
All of this is covered by the wording that we already have.

The wording gives Parliament the power to choose the resources for the Voice, as well as how many people will be part of it and how they are chosen.  This is roughly the same as the power Parliament has to choose its own resources, the number of members it has, and how they are elected.  This allows Parliament to respond to changing demographics and other contexts without having to have a referendum every few years.

Constitutional language sometimes differs from everyday language, so it can seem vague and confusing at times.  However, there's a consensus among Constitutional scholars that all the significant powers and limitations of the Voice are fixed by the referendum wording - it won't be able to sneak in more later.
