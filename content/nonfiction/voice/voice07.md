### Is the Voice racist? - Oct 2, 2023

So, is the Voice racist?

I think the answer is no.

First, race is a social and legal idea but not a scientific one.  That means that race is roughly whatever we make it up to be.

The Voice is going to represent the original political communities of Australia.  Like all political communities, including modern Australia, they have principles by which they choose their own members, such as whether their parents were members.

The Australian social and legal concepts of race are largely based on membership of these original political communities.  The British often persecuted, killed and dispossessed First Nations peoples of their land based upon their membership of their race.  The Australian government often persecuted, excluded and dispossessed First Nations peoples based on their race.  They also took children from their parents based on their race.

All these policies have left these political communities devastated - often without their lands, their children, and opportunities.  The impact is generational, economic, cultural and traumatic.  These injustices were carried out targeting people of a certain race.  There is no way to address these injustices and their consequences without also giving special attention to people of a certain race.

Some definitions of "racism" focus on discrimination by race.  This is the "neutral" definition that doesn't imply that racism is necessarily a bad thing.  With this definition the policies carried out against First Nations peoples were racist, and the Voice, by being discriminatory about who can participate, could be considered racist as well.

Other definitions of racism focus on discrimination that causes harm or disadvantage.  This is the more value-laden definition that suggests racism is a bad thing. With this definition the policies against First Nations peoples are racist, but the Voice would only be racist if it causes disadvantage or harm.

There's no mechanism in the Voice that allows First Nations peoples to enrich themselves or target others with punitive policies, because any policy the Voice proposes can only be enacted if a government elected by all Australian citizens legislates it.

Primarily the Voice is going to address "Closing the Gap", including conditions of disadvantage that many First Nations peoples are in.
I don't think the Voice is racist.  Sometimes we need to give special consideration to a particular group of people, and we can do so in a way that won't create disadvantage for others.
