### Aftermath - Oct 18, 2023

There is some preliminary research into Yes and No voters - I expect we will see more in the future and more comprehensive reports overall.  I’m not in a position to provide a great deal of analysis, but going through the report there were a few things of note.

The first is that although uneducated, older and more rural voters skewed towards No, educated, younger and more urban voters seemed relatively split rather than breaking completely towards Yes.  

Labor voters were split, while Greens voters swung heavily Yes and Coalition and One Nation voters swung heavily No.  I think this is a bit telling - bipartisanship would probably have shifted some of those Coalition voters, and I think they were more split to start with than they ended up.

People who didn’t understand the Voice were predominantly No voters, while people who did understand the Voice were split.

The big theme here is that it was hard to get any demographic well into Yes territory, except Greens voters (interesting given that the Greens as a party were more divided than Labor on this issue).  By most breakdowns about a 50-50 split was the best that was achieved for Yes.

There was one big exception to this: people who believed that First Australians face comparitively more discrimination than white Australians clearly broke for Yes, while people who thought they faced equal or less discrimination clearly broke for No.

The two biggest reasons that people voted No were apparently that it would be divisive and that there were more important issues, which I don’t think are genuine critiques of the proposition itself.

So some of the big reasons Yes didn’t get up were a failure to communicate the idea well, a lack of bipartisanship, and community apathy.  But perhaps the biggest reason is either lack of awareness, or a refusal to believe, that First Australians face greater discrimination than white Australians.  Is this an educational issue, an awareness issue, or a racist perspective?
