### Constitutionality - Oct 6, 2023

Okay, but why does the Voice need to be in the Constitution?  Couldn't it do its job just as a legislated body?

I think constitutional enshrinement provides some things that a legislated body would lack.

First, a constitutionally enshrined body can make statements that are published directly, clearly, on the record, be easily accessible - and which don't require parliamentary permission or oversight.   This means that the public will have an easier time hearing it and the government - even if they don't adopt the recommendations - will have greater media and public pressure to say least provide a response.

Second, the body will have legitimacy - that is, people will generally recognise it as the "correct" body to make such statements on behalf of First Nations peoples, just like the government is the "correct" body to make other political and diplomatic statements (even if the public sometimes disagrees with them).

Third, constitutional enshrinement will make it harder to remove, which will make the members more likely to give free and frank advice.  If it were a legislated body, making honest statements that are critical of government policy might lead to its dissolution, so members would curtail what they were saying.

Constitutional enshrinement will give the Voice independence, which is necessary for a body that, while it will generally work cooperatively, may need to challenge the government at times.
