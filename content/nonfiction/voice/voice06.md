### Symbolism or real power? - Sept 26, 2023

I think there's some confusion at times over what the Voice will do, and whether it will be powerful or not.  Some people say it will be too powerful, and others say that it will be only symbolic.

The proposed Constitutional wording is that it will be able to "make representations" to Parliament and executive government.

Based on this wording, it won't be able to introduce legislation, amend legislation, veto legislation, hand out funding, run departments, or anything similar. 

It will be able to say words, in an official capacity, to the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the rest of the legislature.  The exact way it will be able to do this, and the resources it will have to gather information and put words together, as well as who will be able to sit in it, will be up to Parliament and can be changed by Parliament.  This is pretty similar to the way that Parliament can already change its standing orders, the number of members of the house and senate, how they are funded, and how those members are selected.

So if it can only say things in an official capacity, what powers does it really have?  Well, the biggest two are the powers of scrutiny and agenda-setting.  

Scrutiny means that they can give feedback on government bills or actions, and agenda-setting means that they can raise issues that are otherwise being ignored.  When these types of words come from a Constitutionally enshrined government body, it means that they'll likely have the resources to make them well-researched words, the words will be recorded in official and public documents, the media will likely report on them, and the government will likely feel pressure to respond.

This sort of discourse is an important part of the policy cycle.  Policies don't just appear in Parliament from nowhere - they come from discourse between parliamentarians, the public, interest groups, experts, and businesses.

Currently businesses have a lot of discourse power - they can fund advertisements to oppose government policy that negatively affects them, for example.  First Nations peoples don't have the power of the Minerals Council... unless we vote for it.
