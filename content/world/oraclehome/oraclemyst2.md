Rehmu writes that the oracle is <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>“the place where a person can place some of their will to meet the will of the world”</span> and that the stones <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>“show how those wills might collide, if they are as they are”,</span>.  The oracle doesn’t show the future, says Rehmu, but <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>“reveals the sense of things unknown, and the paths to the future that stem from that”</span>.  Thus, the oracle is not tied to fate or destiny, and doesn’t merely convey probability, but the character of one’s current movement in the world, and how the world might react.

Imbi-Anaki says, similarly, <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>“throwing the stones is like placing one’s foot into a river to see how cold it is, and how poisonous”</span>, where the sense of heat is defined by both the temperature of the river and the temperature of the person, and what is irritates the skin of some does not irritate the skin of others.  We can check the river, Imbi-Anaki says, even though <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>“it is not a thing, but a hurry”</span>, because <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>“the nature of the river is broad, though each drop is specific”</span>, and thus the oracle can tell us about the broader world without having to contain knowledge of all it.

Not all students of the oracle agree - Helet-Helet says that the stones <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>“show stones”</span> and <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>“all else is imagined”</span>.  The oracle still works, she claims, because <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>“what we see of the world is a reading, with meaning and future and past inscribed on things that do not contain them, from poured wine to broken bowls”</span>, but that using the oracle <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>“is when we choose to see”</span>.  For Helet-Helet, the oracle is useful, but only because we are deliberately blind to other readings in all other things.
