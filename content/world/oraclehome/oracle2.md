The River Spirit Oracle is oldest and most successful oracle used by people to commune with the spirits of the land, contact the dead, and foresee the future.  It involves throwing stones and recording how they land.  Initially its mysteries were known only by diviners given the power, reportedly, by the Grandmother of Wisdom herself, who took pity on peoples shrouded from the great spirits.  Diviners had special rooms with statues of the Grandmother, and operated in silence, for a donation of grain or wine, to answer questions for the common and the wealthy.  Lanthoë’s records indicate that the diviner in Rainspell Plains was driven out because she had accepted a bolt of silk, while the Silent Palace was built in Treasured Glade where even the sweepers had their mouths sealed with wax at the beginning of each day.

Many oracles wrote each question and each reading and kept them; the most common questions were about weather, crops, disease, money, travel, and childbirth.  Royal oracles had many of their readings painted on the walls, which means that most are lost.  Very few seem to relate to war, and most to succession - one theory is that war was largely made without asking the oracle, because the great spirits always frowned on the aggressor.

Originally the oracle stones were made of ordinary stones bathed in blood and milk, later they were rare stones.  Nowdays most kopheri game sets have tiles that can double as oracle stones, and as poorer people learnt to read more often divining became a less specialised skill.  It is not unusual now to see an oracle in each household, used mostly on ceremonial occasions and before long trips.
