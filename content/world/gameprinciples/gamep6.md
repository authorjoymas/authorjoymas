### Building the river

The river is a set of river tiles that splits the board into two sections.  The river tiles show the start (wellspring) and end (rivermouth) of the river at opposite ends of the board, as well as the bends that the river takes in the middle of the board.  An invisible line is drawn from the wellspring, through the bends, and to the rivermouth.  The tiles are placed on the points between squares, and do not take up playing space.

The river is generally built by the players at the beginning of the game, with players taking turns to place river tiles in order from wellspring to rivermouth.  Each tile must be facing the previous tile.

The river typically splits the board into two parts, and often the principle of balance is applied to the two sides of the river rather than to two equal halves of the board.
