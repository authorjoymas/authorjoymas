### Balance

Balance is a fundamental principle of several games, and serves to keep pieces distributed across the board.  A balanced board is an extra condition that players must strive to achieve.  In a game that requires balance, <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>a player may not play a tile into a position when it would mean one half of the board has _three or more tiles_ than the other half</span>.  This applies to the vertical and the horizontal division of the board.

Players can keep track of balance by placing one or two spare tiles at the edge of a half to indicate if it has one or two more tiles than the other half.
