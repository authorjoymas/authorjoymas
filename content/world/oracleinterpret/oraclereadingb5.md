<span style='color: #5D8C98;'> _river or dust, or stillness with festival_</span>


---


<span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>“progress or poverty, or inaction with community”</span>

The first section, “progress or poverty”, suggests a choice between going ahead on a journey or ending up lacking something important.

The second section, “inaction with community”, suggests that staying with friends, family or others will prevent a journey.

The whole reading is a choice between a choice between journeying or going without and staying with friends and staying put.

This suggests the reading might be “Going ahead alone will prevent want, but staying with others will suffice.”
