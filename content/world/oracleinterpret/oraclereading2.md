Once you have a completed reading, you will want to interpret it.  There is a standard way of understanding many of the elements of a reading, which are detailed in the rest of this guide.  The exact interpretation is dependent upon the question asked and the position that the questioner finds themselves in.

Each stone reading has an associated meaning, and each path creates a relationship between those meanings.

This chart provides a quick guide to the readings.

Readings are grouped together into two sets, joined by a central path.  For example,

<span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>_Blossom or river, or saltwater without tea_</span>

The first reading to be interpreted should be “blossom or river”, and the second “salterwater without tea”, and then they should be considered with the central path, “or” connecting them.
