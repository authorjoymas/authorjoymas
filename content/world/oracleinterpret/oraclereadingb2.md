**With**

The _with_ path indicates that two readings are intimately associated and can only come together.  For example, _blossom with tea_, "goal with rest", suggests that rest _is_ the goal, while _salterwater and paper_, "injury with knowledge", suggests that an injury provides a lesson.

**Without**

The _without_ path suggests that the first reading does not contain any aspect of the second reading.  For example, _blossom without tea_ suggests that a goal will be reached but the goal will not be restful or bring rest.

---

**Or**

The _or_ path indicates there is a choice to take either aspect, but not both.  For example, _festival or paper_ suggests that you can spend time with the community but miss out on important knowledge, or that you can obtain that knowledge at the expense of spending time with the community.

**Brings**

The _brings_ path suggests that one reading will bring the other with it, _if_ it is chosen.  For example, _blossom brings tea_ means that achieving a goal will result in rest afterwards, while _injury brings knowledge_ suggests that you will learn something as a result of great effort.
