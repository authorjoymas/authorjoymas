<span style='color: #5D8C98;'> _dust without festival, without dust without tea_</span>

<span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>“poverty without community, without poverty without rest”</span>

The first section, “poverty without community”, suggests a lack of community.

The second section, “poverty without rest”, suggests a lack of rest and time for oneself.

The whole, however, has the “poverty without community” _without_ “poverty without rest”, suggesting that you will lack community but not lack rest.  The reading might then be considered:

“A lack of community but not a lack of rest.”
