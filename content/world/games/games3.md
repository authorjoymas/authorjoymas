Kopheri tiles are a standard set of game tiles used since almost the beginning of written history to play games of chance and strategy.  The oldest known sets were simply made with river stones of different colours, probably painted, while other ancient sets include wooden tokens with written characters burnt onto them.  Gambling games are included in the travelling songs of the riverfolk, while scenes depicting kopheri tiles were painted on the walls of the Houses of Spears in Endless Plains and Hungry River.

The tiles themselves were probably influenced by the Oracle - a set of stones thrown to ask questions of the great spirits - and eventually kopheri tiles became the usual way to use the Oracle, perhaps because the tiles were so ubiquitous.  When the high priest of Hungry River marched to war, some said it was because the board at the end of a game of spears and ministers laid out an Oracle reading of fighting or dying.  (Most reports state that she had lost the game, which reflected the results of the campaign.)

The tiles themselves represented significant features such as grain, salt, reeds, stone, blossoms, blood, clay, wood, bronze, and the river, though few to no sets included all of these.  All sets included the river, however, which plays a prominent and thematic role in many games.
