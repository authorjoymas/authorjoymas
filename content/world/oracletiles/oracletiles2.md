The oracle consists of thirteen stones, tiles or other small objects that are held in the hands and shaken while the user asks a question, and then thrown in the air.  Many oracle-readers throw the stones over a tray of sand, known as the tableau, both so that the stones land softly, without bouncing, but also so that they can draw lines during the reading.
