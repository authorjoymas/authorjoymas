### The River Tiles

Six of the tiles are river tiles - the wellspring, first, second, third and fourth bends, and the rivermouth.  If using stone, they are usually blue or light grey, and are individually marked, because they must be read in order.  These stones mark out the four different reading areas.  If using game tiles, they are represented by marked blue tiles.
