### 2. The river bend

To make a reading you must identify four river bends and read them one by one.  The first river bend is made by drawing a line from the edge of the tableau through the wellspring tile until you reach the first bend tile, and then from the first bend tile to the second bend tile and out to the edge of the tableau.  This line will split the tableau into two parts, the portion “inside” the river bend and the portion “outside” the bend.

In this example, the salt stone, one ichor stone and two embers stones are inside the bend.
