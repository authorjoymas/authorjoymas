### 4. The path between bends

For each of the first three bends, there is a defined “path” between the earlier bend and the later bend, determined by two features of the earlier bend: whether the guide tile is inside or outside the bend, and whether the next river tile is inside or outside the bend.


There are four possible outcomes, each indicating a different path.  In the example tableau, the guide tile is inside the end but the next river tile - the third bend tile - is outside the bend, giving the path "or".
