### 5. Repeat for the second, third and fourth bends

Once the reading and path for the first bend is complete, you will next need to identify the second bend.  This consists of drawing a set of lines similar to that of the first bend, but instead dictated by the first, second and third bend tiles.  The third bend will be defined by the second, third and fourth bend tiles, and the fourth bend will be defined by the third, fourth and rivermouth tiles.  Because the fourth bend is the last bend, there is no path from this bend to the next.
