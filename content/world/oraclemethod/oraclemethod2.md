There are several steps to using the oracle successfully, described below.  First, one needs to gather the thirteen tiles or some set of objects that can be used in their place - they must be small enough to hold in your hands and distinct enough to make the reading.  It is also important to have a soft landing space that the tiles will not bounce away from, and large enough to contain them.

### 1. The throw

First, take all thirteen tiles in your cupped hands and conceal them.  Ask the oracle the question you wish to know the answer to, and shake the tiles in your hand gently but deliberately.  When you have finished asking the question, release the tiles upwards and outwards so that they spill onto the tableau you have prepared.  The tiles should ideally scatter with at most a few fingerwidths between each.
