### 3. Taking the reading

The reading for the first bend is completed by identifying all the tiles that fall inside the first bend.  The presence and number of the salt, ichor and ember tiles indicate the nature of the first bend.  This chart shows the reading for each combination of tiles.

In the example tableau, the salt stone, ichor stone and two ember stones indicate “blossom”.
