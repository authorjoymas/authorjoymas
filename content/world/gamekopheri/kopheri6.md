**Balance**

 <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>A player may not play a tile into a position when it would mean one half of the board has _three or more tiles_ than the other half</span>.  This applies to the vertical and the horizontal division of the board.

Players can keep track of balance by placing one or two spare tiles at the edge of a half to indicate if it has one or two more tiles than the other half.
