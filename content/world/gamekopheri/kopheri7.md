### Scoring

Players finish placing tiles when either both players have passed, neither player can legally place a tile, or because one player has run out of tiles (in which case the other player may take one extra turn).

Once players have finished placing tiles, they take turns picking up patterns and scoring them.

**Ordinary patterns**

An ordinary pattern is one with no magisterial tiles.  It consists of three or four tiles of the same colour.

**Magisterial patterns**

A magisterial pattern is an ordinary pattern but with a magisterial tile in it.  A player has two options when picking up a magisterial pattern: they may either pick up all the tiles except the magisterial tile (leaving it on the board for another pattern), or they may pick up all the tiles including the magisterial tile and score double.
