### The goal

The goal of kopheri is to make patterns on the board with tiles of the same colour - either lines of three pieces, triangles, crosses or squares, each of which will gain you points at the end of the game.  Players take turns placing one piece down at a time onto one of the squares on the board, until they can place no more pieces, at which point they remove and score their patterns.

### Set-up

Players each pick two sets of tiles, so that each player has two colours.

Kopheri begins with one tile from each coloured set placed on the board, taking up the centre space of each quarter.  A player cannot have two of their tiles facing each other - that is, players tiles must be placed in diagonally opposite quarters.
