A traditional form of poetry is _tuu liÃ«-ma_ poetry, or "falling petal" poetry.  These are short and gentle poems that quickly paint a scene or evoke an emotion.  Poems in this form must draw all but one of their words from a strict wordlist of fifty words (known as the "court" or the "garden") and a single word from outside the list (known as the "dignitary" or "wandering" word).
