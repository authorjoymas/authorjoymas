The tiles and board can be used to play several different popular games.  By far the most enduring, most discussed and most depicted is simply called _kopheri_, though whether the game drew its name from the tiles or the tiles from the game is unknown; the word itself simply means ‘pattern’.  Kopheri has been the subject of written academic debate and is frequently played both in estate houses and on street corners.  It is regarded as the premier game of strategy, not necessarily because of its skill requirement, but because of its peaceful and puzzling nature.  In a game of Kopheri two players attempt to bring balance and harmony to the board by creating patterns and obstructing their opponent.

Other games include the warlike _Spears and Ministers_, where two sides fight to drag a Grand Minister to their side of the board for capture, or _River, Sowing, Trading_, where players gamble on where a piece will land.  Children often play _Wandering Mysterian_, where they must cross the board by finding patterns in the laid out tiles, or _Market Stalls_, where they place tiles secretly.  Not all games use the board, such as _Five Banners_, where players guess what tiles other players are about to place down.
