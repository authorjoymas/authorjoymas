### Hierarchy

The pieces in _Spears and Ministers_ can only moved if a superior piece is in the same quandrant as they are.  A quadrant in an ordinary game is the same as a marked quarter of the board.  If playing with the river, the borad is bisected horizontally by the river and vertically by at the halfway line, creating four uneven quadrants.

Ordinary tiles, called _spears_, can only move if a decorated tile or a magisterial tile is in the same quadrant.

Decorated tiles, called _marshals_, can only move if the magisterial tile is in the same quandrant.

Magisterial tiles, called _generals_, can always move.
