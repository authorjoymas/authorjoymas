### The pieces

_Spears and Ministers_ uses an ordinary kopheri board, the river tiles, a magisterial piece, and nine tiles per player: five ordinary pieces, three deocrated pieces and one magisterial piece all of the same colour.

They are set up on the board as shown, with the extra magisterial piece in the middle.  This is the Grand Minister.

If players are playing the traditional version, they complete setup by [building the river](/gameprinciples.html).
