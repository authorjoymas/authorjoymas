### Movement

All tiles move in the same manner: either one space in any direction, including diagonally, or in a _lunge_ - one tile forward orthogonally and one tile forward diagonally.

If a tile lands on an opposing tile <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>after completing a lunge</span>, the opposing tile is captured and removed from the board.

A tile cannot lunge if the intervening space is blocked by another tile of any colour.

If playing with the river, a lunge is the only way to cross the river.
