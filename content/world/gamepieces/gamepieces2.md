### The Tiles

Standard kopheri sets include six sets of eighteen tiles - blue river tiles, red clay tiles, purple blossom tiles, gold grain tiles, black stone tiles and green reed tiles.

Tiles in each of the five ‘ordinary’ sets come in three variations: ten ordinary tiles, six decorated tiles, and two magisterial tiles.
