### The River Tiles

The river tiles are distinct: they have a wellspring tile, a rivermouth tile, two magisterial tiles, and several river-bend tiles representing the first, second, third and fourth bends.

Many games use the river tiles in a distinct manner, though the importance of this has decreased over generations.
