### The Board

Many kopheri games are played on a kopheri board.  Because of the variety of games the size of boards varies, though they are usually squares, such as five-by-five, six-by-six, or ten-by-ten.  Boards have been drawn on paper, burnt into wood, engraved into stone, or constructed out of multiple triangles of wood or stone, with several beautiful designs.  The palace at Great Crossing had a kopheri board built into the floor out of polished stones, wood and glass, complete with a river dividing the space in two.

A standard board now is organised in a manner that allows for all the basic board sizes to be played, as well identifiable halves and quarters to represent an unbending river.
