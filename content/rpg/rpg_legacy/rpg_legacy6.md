### Legacy unit complete


Now that your legacy unit has a title, a size, and up to six characteristics, it is complete.  You are now ready to create other units by _making history_, a process where you [detach and attach](/rpg_detach.html) other units from your legacy unit.  This will populate your faction with more units for you to use throughout the game.
