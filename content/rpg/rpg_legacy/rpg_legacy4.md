**Characteristics**

Just like your culture card, your legacy unit (and every other unit) will need some characteristics (at least three and up to six).

The characteristics on this card apply only to this particular unit, so you can eventually have units that wildly vary.

The characteristics of a unit can be qualities that the unit exhibits (e.g. _keen sight_), members that compose the unit (e.g. _archers_), or equipment that the unit has (e.g. _8-foot spears_), or most likely a mix of all three.

Remember that the characteristics will be ordered from the top of the card to the bottom, numbered from 6 to 1.  The higher up the card, the more useful they will be.
