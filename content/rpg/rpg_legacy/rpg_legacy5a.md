**Chips or tokens**

Integrity is represented by chips or tokens (such as poker chips), placed onto the index card of the unit.  Each unit will have their own Integrity that can go up or down, so keeping track of which is which is important.

**Legacy unit**

Your legacy unit will start with 10 Integrity, so you can immediately place 10 chips onto the index card for the unit.
