**Index card**

Each unit in your faction is going to have its own index card (or dedicated space on a piece of paper).  Similar to your culture card, your legacy unit is going to have a title, and up to six characteristics.  However, while your culture card applies to _all_ the units in your faction, the characteristics of a unit only apply to _itself_.  

(Okay, this is not _quite_ true - see [Attachments and Detachments](/rpg_detach.html) for more on this later.)

Your legacy unit is also going to have two extra features that your culture card did not: a size, and some Integrity.

First, start off with your title.  If your legacy unit is a city, you could name the city (e.g. Arachnopolis) or just give it a simple description (e.g. "Capital City").
