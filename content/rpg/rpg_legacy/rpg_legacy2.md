### Making a Legacy Unit


Your legacy unit is the first, most central, largest and most prominent unit of your faction.  It might be the unit that you use the most, or it might be a unit that you keep in the background like a home base.

If you are playing a city-state, your legacy unit might be the central city.  If you are playing an army, it might be the main host or the headquarters.  If you are playing a guild it could the gulid headquarters or the primary representatives of the guild.  Your legacy unit could be a village, a band of thieves, a royal family or even a heroic individual.

Once you have your legacy unit, you can go through the process of _making history_ and use it to create other units in your faction.
