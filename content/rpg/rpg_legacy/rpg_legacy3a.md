**Size**

Underneath your unit's title will be the size of your unit.  In _All the Rivers and Mountains_ the concept of size is quite general, and should be either 1s, 10s, 100s, 1,000s, or 10,000s.  (You can, of course, go higher, and if playing the space variant it might be necessary to go into the billions or trillions.)

The size of your unit will determine a few different things: what sort of units can detach from it, such as a squad detaching from an army, how it will fare against bigger or smaller units, and how long it can last in combat.

If playing as a single, individual character, the unit size will be 1.
