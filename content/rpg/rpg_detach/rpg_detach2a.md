**Overview**

Like many common actions in the game, detacing a unit involves resolving a dice roll.

To detach a unit, first describe to the GM the unit you want to make, pick a focus characteristic from your main unit (that your new unit is detaching from), roll and reroll the dice to count your successes, and then apply your successes to the new unit.  If you didn't get all the successes you wanted, you can _force success_ by paying with Integrity.

This process of making a plan, picking a focus characteristic, rolling and rerolling and applying and forcing successes is the same for most actions in the game.
