**Spend your successes**

Your successes allow you to further customise the unit.  Each success allows you one change, such as:


<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li>adding a characteristic</li>

<li>adding a point of Integrity</li>
</ul>





**Force success**

If you didn't get what you want and you don't have enough successes to change it, you can spend the Integrity of the main unit to pay for a change.

Alternatively, you can ask the GM to add an additional Weakness to your unit in exchange for making an extra change.
