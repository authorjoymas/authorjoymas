**Pick a focus characteristic**

To start the process of detachment, find a main unit to detach your new unit from.  For your first detached unit, this should be your legacy unit.  Next, you'll need to pick a characteristic of that main unit to form the basis of your detached unit - this is the _focus characteristic_.

For example, a peaceful temple of monks might have the characteristics _pious, knowledge of the spirits_ and _determined_.  If you want to make a detachment of warrior-monks from this temple, your best bet might be _determined_.

This characteristic is going to define a lot about your detached unit, so you need to pick it carefully.

Every characteristic has a number next to it.  The number of your focus characteristic will be important to determine how successful your roll is and what Integrity your newly detached unit starts with.  The higher the number, the more likely your roll is to succeed and the more Integrity your newly detached unit will have.
