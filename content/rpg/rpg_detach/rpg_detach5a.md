**Get some Integrity**

Now you can give your unit some Integrity.  To determine the amount of Integrity it will receive, simply look at the number next to the focus characteristic on the main unit.  Remember that characteristics are numbered starting with 6 at the top, down to 1 for the last characteristic.

If you pick the characteristic numbered 4, then your detached unit will start with 4 Integrity.  You can add 4 tokens or chips to the index card.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>(!) Inherit Integrity</th>
      </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>A newly detached unit will start with Integrity equal to the number of the focus characteristic of the main unit.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
