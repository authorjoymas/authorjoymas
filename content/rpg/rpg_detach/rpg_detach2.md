## Detaching Units


Almost every unit in _All the Rivers and Mountains_ can create new units in a process called _detachment_, or add to their characteristics in a process called _attachment_.  Now that you have a culture card and a legacy unit, you are ready to _make history_ by creating new units.  The process of making history is a set-up stage where you flesh out your unit roster by detaching and attaching units from your legacy unit, evoking a sense of your original faction expanding over time.

Detachment is a process by which a new unit emerges from an existing unit - for example, an assassin squad detaching from an army to complete a secret mission, or an ambassador detaching from a diplomatic delegation to stay behind.  If a village sends out a hunting party, the hunting party will detach from the village, or if a city wants to send out a trade caravan the trade caravan will be detached from the city.

Detached units are complete units in their own right.  They can explore, move, fight, and influence others.  Like your legacy unit, a detached unit will have a title, size, Integrity, Motivation, and up to six characteristics.  Each unit should have its own index card.

The new units you create can themselves create new units through detachment, and those units can create new units, and so on, and so on.  Detachment and attachment are ordinary actions that you can take throughout the game, detaching new units when necessary.  For example, if your army is travelling along a mountain-pass and wants to scout ahead, you could detach a scouting party to advance before the main unit.
