**Make a new unit**

A detached unit will inherit some qualities from the unit it is attaching from, and get some new qualities created by you, but dependent upon the roll of the dice.

To make a detachment, first choose what you want your new unit to be.  Perhaps it is a logical or thematic extension of your legacy unit - if your legacy unit is a fishing village, perhaps you will need a fleet of ships.  Or perhaps you will need to consider how to address the weaknesses in your legacy unit.  For example, a temple of monks might need a small detachment of warrior-monks to face any combat challenges.  You could consider what might be fun - a travelling circus, a cadre of spies, a village uprising.

Once you've selected the type of new unit you want to make, pick up a new index card and write the title on it.
