**Roll**

Now it's time to roll the dice to see how successful you are at detaching a unit, and how many of the unit's qualities you can control and update.

First, check the Integrity of the main unit.  For your legacy unit this should be 10.  Your dice pool will be that many dice, plus 4 - in this case, 14.

The outcomes on the dice are all associated with different characteristics from the main unit - the 6s are associated with the top characteristic (numbered 6), and the 1s are associated with the last characteristic (numbered 1).  Each dice counts as a success for that characteristic.

You are looking for successes for the focus characteristic that you chose.  For example, if you are detaching a unit based on the characteristic numbered 4, then any 4s on the dice will be successes.

You now have a chance to reroll.  Keep all the successes that you rolled, and reroll every dice that is _below_ the focus characteristic number.  For example, if your focus characteristic was a 4, your 4s are successes and you can reroll all the 3s, 2s and 1s.  Any new 4s that you get also count as successes.

This type of roll and reroll is the same for all challenge resolutions in the game.  Detachments are a typical and common challenge that you might come across in play.

    <tr>
    <td>You get one chance to reroll all the dice who face is lower than the focus characteristic's number.</td>
    </tr>
