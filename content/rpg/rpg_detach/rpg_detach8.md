**Complete the detachment**

The detachment is almost complete - now you should have an index card with a title, a size, up to six characteristics and some Integrity.  It is a fully-fledged unit ready to go out into the world and explore, influence, fight, and make detachments of its own.

When making history, you can detach multiple units from your main unit, and you can also detach new units from the units that you've just made, and detach new units from those units, and so on.  Starting with your legacy unit you can grow your faction in any direction you choose and flesh out what sort of units live within it.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>(!) Integrity check</th>
      </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>If the detachment ends up with more Integrity than the main unit, the main unit loses 1 Integrity.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

You're now ready to explore [making attachments](/rpg_attach.html).
