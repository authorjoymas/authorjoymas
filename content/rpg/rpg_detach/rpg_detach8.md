**Complete the detachment**

The detachment is almost complete - now you should have an index card with a title, a size, a Motivation, a Weakness, six characteristics and some Integrity.  It is a fully-fledged unit ready to go out into the world and explore, influence, fight, and make detachments of its own.

The last thing to check for before your detachment is complete is to see if the Integrity of your detached unit is greater than the Integrity of your main unit.  If it is, for any reason, then the main unit should have had its Integrity reduced by 1.  This represents expertise, power or influence leaving the main unit.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>(!) Integrity check</th>
      </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>If the detachment ends up with more Integrity than the main unit, the main unit loses 1 Integrity.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

You're now ready to explore [making attachments](/rpg_attach.html).
