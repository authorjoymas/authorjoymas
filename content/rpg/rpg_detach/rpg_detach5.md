**Inherit characteristics**

Your detached unit is going to inherit the focus characteristic of your main unit - for example, if you picked _determined_ then the detached unit is also going to have _determined_ as a characteristic.  In fact, the detached unit will have _determined_ as its **top** characteristic.

If the focus characterist was a description of the composition of your main unit - for example, you picked the characteristic _archers_ to detach a group of archers, then instead of inheriting the characterist as the new top characteristic, the new unit will inherit this as part of its **title**.
