**Inherit characteristics**

Your detached unit is going to inherit the focus characteristic of your main unit - for example, if you picked _determined_ then the detached unit is also going to have _determined_ as a characteristic.  In fact, the detached unit will have _determined_ as its **top** characteristic.

The detached unit will then inherit any characteristics listed _after_ the focus characteristic.  If you pick the top characteristic of the main unit as the focus characteristic of the detached unit, then the two units will have identical characteristics.  But if you pick, say, the third characteristic, then the detached unit will inherit the third, fourth, fifth and sixth characteristics, making them the first, second, third and fourth characteristics of the newly detached unit.

This might leave your detached unit with less than six characteristics.  You are now free to create all-new characteristics to fill those empty slots.

You are also free to choose a Motivation that best suits this unit.

But wait - don't write anything down on your card yet.  There's a chance to change up some of these details, depending on how you roll, which is described in a moment.
