**Pick a size**

One of the first things you'll need to do is pick a size for your detached unit.  Picking a size should be intuitive - simply think about how many people will be leaving the main unit for the detached one.  A detached unit **cannot** be bigger than the main unit, however.

If the detached unit is the _same_ size as the main unit, the main unit will **lose 1 Integrity**.  This represents that a sizeable group is leaving the main unit.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>(!) Size constraint</th>
      </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>If a detaching unit is the same size as the main unit, the main unit will lose 1 Integrity.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A detaching unit cannot be bigger than the main unit.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
