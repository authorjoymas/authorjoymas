**Types of conditions**

There are various conditions that an innovation can add to a unit.

**Motivation**

An innovation can add an additional Motivation to a unit.  Motivations can cost the unit Integrity if they act against their Motivation, and can be targeted when a player wants to influence the unit.  By adding an extra condition, you can make it more difficult for a unit to operate freely, and easier to convince to help you.  You can only target a temporary Motivation for influence once - after that it will disappear.

**Blessing**

A blessing is an additional and temporary characteristic that is applied to a unit.  When using this as a focus characteristic you can count 6s as successes, and you have one reroll of all dice that show are number less than six.  Once you've used the temporary characteristic, it will disappear.

**Weakness**

A Weakness is a status that describes some way in which the unit is weak.  Weaknesses can cost the unit Integrity if they engage with their Weakness, and can be targeted in combat to prevent a resistance roll.  Once a Weakness has been targeted in combat, it will disappear.
