**Make a plan**

For an innovation, your plan will have the following steps:

A **method** that explains how the special ability is enacted - for example, casting a spell, setting up a trebuchet, firing burning arrows, or channelling your inner spirit.

A **target** that your innovation will affect.  If you want to target more than one target, you'll need more than one success.  If you want to target a bigger target than you, you'll need an success for each difference of magnitude.

An **effect** - the Aspect, Blessing, Weakness or Motivation you wish to apply to the target.  If you want to apply more than one, you'll need more than one step.

**Continue as normal**

The next steps of picking a focus characteristic, rolling and rerolling, counting successes, checking for resistance and buying more success are the same as always.
