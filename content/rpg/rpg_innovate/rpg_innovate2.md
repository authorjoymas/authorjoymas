When words don't work and bloodshed seems too much, or too difficult, there is room to innovate.  "Innovations" is a catch-all term for things types of special abilities, technologies, martial approaches, magic, spirit entanglement or even just cunning that places another unit into a difficult situation.

The primary thing that an innovation does is add a Motivation, Aspect or a Weakness to another unit, or to "invoke" an Aspect.  With a new, custom Motivation a unit might be able to be more easily influenced, and with a new custom Weakness a larger unit might become more vulnerable.  A player could create frost magic that particularly affects fire spirits, or burn a field that a well-equipped army is marching through to make them disoriented.

Like other types of challenges, an innovation task includes:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li> making a plan </li>
<li> selecting a focus characteristic </li>
<li> rolling a dice pool of your unit's Integrity plus 4 and checking for successes </li>
<li> rerolling the lower numbered dice </li>
<li> paying Integrity or gaining a Weakness if you want to force success </li>
<li> resolving the successes </li>
</ul>
