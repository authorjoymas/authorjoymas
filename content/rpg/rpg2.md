A player may control a city and raise an army to march towards their enemies, draw an elite squad from the army to infiltrate behind enemy lines, and from that squad follow a lone assassin toward the enemy's leader.  Once the leader is dispatched and the gates are unbarred from teh inside, the player might return focus to the army in order to complete their conquest.  Or perhaps a player will create a trader's guild who sends out representatives to make new diplomatic connections, and marry one of its members into a foregin royal family, only to use the position to conduct espionage.  One player might control a mighty wizard investigating rumours of magic while another sends out multiple groups of explorers to map a new continent.
