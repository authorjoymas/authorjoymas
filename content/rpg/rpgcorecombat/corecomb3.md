### Victory

If an opponent's Integrity is reduced to 0, the player is victorious, and there are two options available: _dissolution_, or _influence_.

If the player chooses dissolution, the opposing unit is disbanded - either scattered, fleeing, or dead.  The player may have the option to rifle through their property.

If the player chooses influence, the opposing unit retains their last bit of Integrity - whatever Integrity was left before the very last blow.  The player can now begin an influence challenge, either to gain information, recruit the unit to their side, or force them to carry out some task.

If the player fails the influence challenge, the opposing unit will immediately disband.

### Counter-attack

If the unit is unsuccessful at completing the combat challenge, then the opponent may begin a counter-attack.

The player will choose a characteristic for their defense, and the GM will construct a rudimentary plan of attack.  The player will then roll and reroll the dice.  For each die assigned to their chosen characteristic, the unit will prevent one step of the GM's plan - working backwards by preventing the last step, then the second-last step, and so on.

If the GM's plan targets the player unit's strength, that step will fail without costing the player a dice.  If the GM's plan targets the player's weakness, they will deal inverse damage to the player - that is, the damage will be equal to six minus the face of the assigned dice.
