A combat challenge occurs whenever a unit enters into combat, either in full-scale warfare between armies, a sortie taking a city guard by surprise, or two individuals corssing swords atop a palace roof in the moonlight.

Combat consists of an _approach_, the chance to _control_ the opponent, and an _engagement_ or a _deadly engagement_.  Players describe the entire plan in advance, before rolling any dice.

Players will need to pick the right sort of characteristics for their combat challenge - for example, _sneaky_ if they are approaching the enemy stealthily, or _disciplined_ if they are moving in formation.

**Approach**

The approach is the step that brings the player's unit into range of the opponent's unit.  Players describe an approach for their unit, such as a stealthy approach, a charge, a pincer manoeuvre, breaking through a window to surprise them, or leaping onto a table to gain a height and reach advantage.

**Control**

The control step is an optional step.  In this step, the player can describe how they would affect the movement of the opponent's unit, such as to pin them down, corral them towards a cliff-edge, contain them, or even make them scatter.

**Engagement**

Engaging the enemy is where enemy blood is shed.  Players can make a simple description that they are attacking.

**Deadly engagement**

If the player completed a step to gain control of the enemy, they can next complete a deadly engagement.  A deadly engagement will deal a severe blow to the enemy's Integrity, and can complete the engagement.  A deadly engagement must be preceded by a control step.  Players can include as many deadly engagements as they want, as long as they achieve control in the preceding step.  Players are encouraged to describe how the deadly engagement might occur, including relating it to the control step - a deadly strike to a pinned enemy, or driving them off the cliff-face.

A unit cannot have a deadly engagement with a larger sized unit.

Once players have made a combat plan, they can roll and reroll the dice.  For each die assigned to the chosen characteristic, one step of the plan will be successful.

If a step targets an enemy weakness - a sneak attack against an unobservant unit, or a quick attack against a slow unit - then the step is automatically successful and does not need a die.

If a step targets an enemy strength (their top characteristic) - a frontal assault on a better-armoured unit, or a sneak attack on a very perceptive unit - then it will be an automatic failure.

A successful engagement will deal 1 damage to the enemy's Integrity.

A successful deadly engagement will deal the value of the die to the enemy's Integrity - for example, for the characteristic that is assigned 5s, a deadly engagement will deal 5 damage.

A deadly engagement requires a successful control step - if the preceding control step is unsuccessful, the deadly engagement becomes a normal engagement.

A failure will mean the unit _takes a hit_ and may lead to a counter-attack.
