Players in _All the Rivers and Mountains_ take on the role of a faction rather than an individual.  In some sense they are the guiding force for the entire group of people, and can choose to guide large groups, small groups or individuals as they see fit.  Players control factions in order to investigate mysteries, understand and protect themselves against threats, secure knowledge and treasures, and expand their sphere of power.  The game also allows players to follow a single character in great detail, either as part of a larger factional storyline or as a standalone mission.

One player takes the role of the Guide to Mysteries, or the GM.  The GM controls neutral factions, the environment and any other natural or unnatural forces that the faction players donâ€™t control.  The GM knows the answers to mysteries, controls the actions of threats and represents the difficulty of the environment.  The GM sets up the game and guides the other players through, allowing them to make their own decisions and shape the world the way they want.
