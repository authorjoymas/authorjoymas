**Environmental units**

While players are focused on creating units and attachments for their factions, the game can also treat the environment, environmental objects and special objects as units and attachments as well.  Throughout adventures, players can find objects of power, gear, materials and locations that they can use when creating a new unit or attachment.

The environment and objects will have index cards with similar information to that of units, with a title and characteristics.  However, instead of a Motivation, inanimate things have a Nature.  A Nature suggests that the environment "does" or what an object is "for".

For example, a misty valley might have a Nature _tendency to conceal_, or perhaps _to make people lost_.  Similarly, an urn might have a Nature _to hold things_, or a sword _to stab_.

If a unit conquers an environment or an object (generally through a navigation task set by the GM), then they can "own" that unit.  In the case of an object, you the player can simply add it as an attachment, and begin to derive other attachments from it.  If an object is made from a superior material, for example, then you can make an attachment that uses that material characteristic as the focus characteristic.  In the case of the environment the unit is not so much "owned" as "borrowed", and while your unit remains in that environment you can treat it like an attachment.
