**Use your imagination**

Crafting using the environment and found objects - including the equipment of opposing factions - allows you to come up with ideas and new units as you work your way through the game or through a longer campaign.  The idea is to be flexible and creative rather than prescriptive and linear, so that you will end up with a faction that is like no one else's.

While crafting suggests that you are making something to take with you, you can also consider it as "being crafty".  If you are in an environment that you have some control over, you can use those environmental characteristics when engaging in combat (for example, using mist to conceal yourself).  You can either do this simply narratively (the easiest way), or you can play a more mechanical game where every environment has a unit card that you can refer to, with ranked characteristics.
