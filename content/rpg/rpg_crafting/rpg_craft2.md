Crafting allows you to make new equipment, learn new techniques, develop new technologies and gain new fundamental knowledge.  Crafting may not always be an essential part of the game for many players, but for a player who sticks with the same units for a long campaign, or for players with only a small focus, such as roving band of brigands or a single warrior-monk, crafting can add detail and progression to the game.

Crafting is essentially a form of making an [attachment](/rpg_attach.html).  However, attachments can come from the environment and from other objects, such as forging an awesome sword from a piece of meteorite.

Detachments are new units that break away from existing units.  This is important when you need to raise an army, start a new village, specialise, pursue two goals at once, form a sneaky plan, or engage with characters on a smaller scale or more individual level.  You might find that you need to make detachments to carry out special plans several times within a game, or you might find that you created everything you needed in the faction creation process.  If you need to make a new detachment during the game, you can remind yourself of the [detachment](/rpg_detach.html) process.
