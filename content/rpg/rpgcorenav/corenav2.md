Navigation challenges occur whenever the player is moving from one place to another, whether armies are travelling over mountains, boats are sailing up rivers, a delegation is finding their destination in a town, a sortie is scaling the walls, an assassin is climbing into a tower or a hapless diplomat is lost within a large palace.

In a navigation challenge, the player selects a characteristic of the unit, such as _rugged_ for a unit climbing over difficult terrain, _stealthy_ for a unit trying to creep successfully through the shadows, _acrobatic_ for a unit trying to scale walls, _knowledge of the city_ or _good with crowds_ for a player making their way through the crowded streets.

Navigation is used when the environment is known and needs traversing in a few steps.  For example, an army using the characteristic _good at marching_ for going over the mountain, down the valley, and across the river.  Or for an assassin climbing a tower with a rope, using the characteristic _rope_ for throwing the rope, climbing the rope, and swinging into the window.  Typically the player will describe their intention and the GM will break it down into formal steps.

The player then rolls and rerolls, assigning dice to their chosen characteristic.  Each dice assigned to the characteristic indicates a successful step in the plan.  If the plan is completely successful, the player makes it to where they were going. If the plan is not successful, the player can either end the plan at the last successful step, or _take a hit_ and complete the plan successfully.  If a player decides to take a hit, they must take one hit for each step remaining that did not have a successful die - for example, if a player rolls two successful dice in a four-step plan, the unit would take two hits.

When a player takes a hit, the GM either reduces the Integrity of the unit by 1, or adds an additional weakness to the unit.
