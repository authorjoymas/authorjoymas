### Culture card complete!

Your completed culture card should now have a title, a Motivation, a Weakness, and six characteristics.

Your culture card indicates qualities that will be shared by every unit in your faction - they will all share the Motivation, the Weakness, and all be able to rely on the characteristics to face challenges.  But each unit will also hav its own unique qualities as well - it's own Motivation, Weakness, and characteristics.

Now that you have a culture card, it's time to make your [legacy unit](/rpg_legacy.html).
