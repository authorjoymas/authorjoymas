**Motivation**

The first thing to add to your culture card is a Motivation.  A Motivation is both a narrative element to help bring life to your faction and guide your role-playing, and a mechanical element that can have gameplay consequences.  Your Motivation can be entirely free-form, but it is best not to make it too complex.

Some Motivation ideas could be:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li>Loyalty to the throne</li>

<li>Desire for power</li>

<li>Love of money</li>

<li>Protection of the realm</li>

<li>Balance with nature</li>

<li>Peace in our time</li>
</ul>

**Motivational consequences**

Your Motivation will have gameplay consequences.  There are two main consequences: a loss of Integrity if a unit goes against its Motivation, and an easier time being influenced if a unit's Motivation is appealed to.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>(!) Integrity</th>
      </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Integrity is a number that acts like a unit's health and morale, as well as determining the size of the dice pool the unit can use.  More Integrity is better than less Integrity.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

Throughout the game you will get your units to performs actions, such as moving, fighting, investigating, trading, diplomacy and the like.  If you ask your units to perform an action that goes against their Motivation, they will lose _Integrity_.  Integrity is a number that represents the health, morale, constitution and power of your units.  Less Integrity means fewer dice to roll, less chance of success, and less chance of survival.  If a unit's Integrity reaches zero, the unit is _disbanded_, and removed from the game.  Taking an action that goes against a unit's Motivation will result in the loss of 1 Integrity point.

For example, if a unit is motivated by _protection of nature_, but is asked to burn down a forest, that unit will be going against its Motivation.  Similarly, if a unit is motivated by _desire for wealth_ but turns down a lucrative trade, the unit will be acting against its Motivation.  The GM can help determine in which situations units might go against their motivation.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>(!) Going against your Motivation</th>
      </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>If a unit performs an action that goes against its Motivation, it will lose 1 Integrity to attempt the action.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
