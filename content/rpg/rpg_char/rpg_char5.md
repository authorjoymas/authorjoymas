**Being influenced**

Your Motivation is also how your units can be influenced by other units.  If a unit from another faction wants to try and influence your unit - to give up information or wealth, to leave the area or comply with a rule, or to carry out a mission - they'll be most successful if they appeal to your unit's motivation.

Similarly, other units will also have Motivations, and if you want to influence the units and characters that you come across, you'll have the best chance of success if you discover and appeal to their Motivations.
