**Characteristics**

Now your index card representing your culture should have a title, a Motivation, and a Weakness.  Next, you will need to add up tp six characteristics.  Characteristics are words or very short phrases that either describe part of the composition of a unit or a quality of the unit. (For a culture card, we will only need to include words and phrases that describe the quality of the unit.)  Characteristics can be free-form, so you can be as creative as you like.

Number your characteristics starting from 6 at the top.

For example, characteristics could include:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >

<li>6. Martial prowess</li>

<li>5. Ruggedness</li>

<li>4. Knowledge of old languages</li>

<li>3. Well-equipped</li>

<li>2. Determined</li>
</ul>

**Gameplay Effects**

Characteristics will describe your culture or units, but will also have mechanical gameplay effects.  Whenever a unit goes to perform a risky or difficult task, you will need to select one of these characteristics as the basis for performing the action, and roll some dice.

The higher up your list a characteristic is placed, the higher chance of success you will have when you appeal to that characteristic.  Your top three characteristics are going to be the most useful for the unit, so make sure you consider them well.

Don't worry if you can't think of six chracteristics immediately - you can always fill out the rest of the card as inspiration occurs to you.  But it will be important to have at least three characteristics so that your faction can face the challenges ahead.
