In _All the Rivers and Mountains_, players role-play as factions rather than individuals.  This guide will give an overview of how to make up a new faction from scratch.  Players can also build from the [example factions](/rpgfactions.html) already provided.

Factions are made up of _units_, such as cities, gulids, temples, religions, armies, villages, councils, scouting parties, delegations, trade caravans, royal families, lone wanderers and whatever else the player can think up.  A player will control a variety of units over the course of the game, inventing new ones and retiring - or losing - old ones.  Character creation will guide the player through the creation of their overarching faction, their very first unit, and building new units - known as _detaching_ or _attaching_ - from old ones.

In general, units are made up of _characteristics_, which are one-or-few word descriptions of some of the qualities of the unit.  These characteristics will become the basis of actions and rolls.

Before creating any units, you should create a _culture_, which is a set of characteristics that all the units of your faction will share.

Players will need index cards (or paper), a pen, some tokens (such as poker chips), and 10d6.
