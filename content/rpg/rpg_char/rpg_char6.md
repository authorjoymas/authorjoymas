**Weakness**

Next, you'll need to pick your culture's Weakness.  Again, the selection of the Weakness is free-form - you can choose whatever you would like - but it does have mechanical consequences.  If a unit takes an action that engages with its Weakness, it will also lose 1 Integrity point.  For example, if a Weakness is _slow_, then making your unit perform a charge will incur a penalty of 1 Integrity.  If your unit is _fearful_ then going into a scary situation would incur a penalty.

If a unit's Weakness is targeted by someone trying to influence or attack them, the move is more likely to be successful.  Of course, opposing units have Motivations and Weaknesses as well, so discovering details about the factions and units you encounter will be helpful in finding success against them.
