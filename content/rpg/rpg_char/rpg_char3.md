### Creating a Faction

A brand new faction can be anything that you can think of - _All the Rivers and Mountains_ is designed to be a flexible game that can accommodate a variety of different settings.  (While the current ruleset descriptions are embedded in a relatively generic fantasy setting, the rules can be adapted to almost any setting, with plans for a futuristic interplanetary setting.)  Your faction could be a city-state, a theocracy, a small village, a nomadic army, a thieves guild, a royal family, a dwarven fortress, an elven woodlands, or even an undead empire.

To start your new faction, first, think up the overall theme and setting for your faction, such as a militant city-state.  Take a few moments to think about some of the narrative and setting details of your new faction.  You might even just play into traditional fantasy stereotypes in order to get an overall impression quite quickly.

### The culture card

The first thing you will create is the culture card.  This is the cultural, spiritual, moral or thematic background to your faction, and every unit in your faction can refer to the contents of this card.  This will ensure some cohesion and commonality between your different units.

Take an index card and write the name of your faction up the top.  This could be as specific as "The Enkharon Fleet" or as simple as "Pirates".

You'll be adding several details to this card: a Motivation, a Weakness, and some characteristics.
