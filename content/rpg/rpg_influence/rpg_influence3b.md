**Getting your way**

If you are successful, the unit will follow your commands or suggestions.  There are two ways to do this:

First, the GM can control the character, and ensure that they follow your appeals.

Second, you can instead opt to control the unit themselves.  For each success, place 1 of your Integrity tokens on the other unit's index card.  When you want to control the other unit, you may spend 1 of the Integrity placed there to control it for a turn.  If it needs to complete a task or engage in combat, it will use your Integrity.  If your Integrity on this unit is depleted, it is no longer under your control.
