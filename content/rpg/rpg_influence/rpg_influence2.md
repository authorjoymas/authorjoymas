At various times you'll need to get the help of others, trick enemies, intimidate people, negotiate deals or just make friends.  The way to do this is with the influence task.  Like other tasks, the influence task has the following steps:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li>  making a plan </li>
<li> selecting a focus characteristic </li>
<li> rolling and rerolling dice pool of your unit's Integrity plus 4 and checking for successes </li>
<li> paying Integrity or gaining a Weakness if you want to force success </li>
</ul>

For influence, your plan will be an argument built on premises, implications, and appeals.

A **premise** is something that is true, or something that you want to pretend is true.  For example, "An army is on its way" or "I have a lot of silk to trade".

An **implication** is an "if" statement that presents the listener with an outcome: "If the army reaches here, they will destroy you", or "If you sell this silk, you will be wealthy".

An **appeal** is where you tell the other unit what you want them to do: "Please help us stop this army" or "Please buy my silk".

Once you've prepared an argument, you can select a focus characteristic, roll the dice, pick and stick, and then count your successes.
