At various times you'll need to get the help of others, trick enemies, intimidate people, negotiate deals or just make friends.  The way to do this is with the influence task.  Like other tasks, the influence task has the following steps:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li>  making a plan </li>
<li> selecting a focus characteristic </li>
<li> rolling and rerolling dice pool of your unit's Integrity plus 4 and checking for successes </li>
<li> the GM rolls and rerolls for resistance </li>
<li> paying Integrity or gaining a Weakness if you want to force success </li>
</ul>

For influence, your plan will be an argument or appeal to another unit.  When influencing a unit, you will describe what you want the opposing unit to do or how you want them to behave.
