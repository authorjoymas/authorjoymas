**Meeting resistance**

If you try to influence a unit - or if a unit tries to influence you - the target unit can roll resistance.

Resistance functions much like any other roll - pick a focus characteristic that you think would help you resist the challenge against you, and roll and reroll to see how many successes you can achieve.  If the challenging unit did not appeal to the Motivation of the target unit, the target unit can treat their Motivation as their first characteristic, and roll for 6s.  For example, if your Motivation is _desire for wealth_ and the unit trying to influence you does not make an argument that appeals to your desire for wealth, then you can roll for resistance where 6s are successes.  This allows you one reroll of every other dice.

Unlike a challenge roll, with a resistence roll you cannot force success.

If the number of successes is greater than the number of successes that the challenging unit had, you resist the influence.
