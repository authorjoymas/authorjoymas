**Forcing success**

If every step of your argument was successful, you have probably convinced the opposing unit.

If not every step as successful, you will not have convinced them.  You can still try to force success by:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >

<li>paying 1 Integrity for each extra success required</li>

<li>getting the GM to give you an extra Weakness for each success required</li>
</ul>
