 
  **Forcing success**

If you have enough successes to overcome their resistance, you convince the opposing unit to act as you have described in your plan.

If you don't have enough successes, you will not have convinced them.  You can still try to force success by:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >

<li>paying 1 Integrity for each extra success required</li>

<li>getting the GM to give you an extra Weakness for each success required</li>
</ul>

---

**Getting your way**

If you are successful, the unit will follow your commands or suggestions.  There are two ways to do this:

First, the GM can control the character, and ensure that they follow your appeals.

Second, you can instead opt to control the unit themselves.  For each success, place 1 of your Integrity tokens on the other unit's index card.  When you want to control the other unit, you may spend 1 of the Integrity placed there to control it for a turn.  If it needs to complete a task or engage in combat, it will use its own Integrity.  If your Integrity on this unit is depleted, it is no longer under your control.
