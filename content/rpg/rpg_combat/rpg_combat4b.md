**Deal damage**

Every success will deal 1 damage to the enemy.

1 point of damage will either:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li>  reduce the target's Integrity by 1 </li>
<li> reduce the target's size by 1 scale </li>
</ul>

For example, a sortie with an Integrity of 4 and a size of 100s that takes 2 points of damage could either

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li> lose 2 Integrity to end up with 2 Integrity and a size of 100s </li>
<li> drop two sizes, to end up with an Integrity of 4 and a size of 1s </li>
<li> lose 1 Integrity and drop 1 size, to end up with an Integrity of 3 and a size of 10s </li>
</ul>

If a unit reaches 0 Integrity of a size of 0, it can be disbanded.
