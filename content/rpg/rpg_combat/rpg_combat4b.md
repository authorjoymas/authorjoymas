**Deal damage**

A successful _strike_ will deal 1 damage.

A successful _deadly strike_ will deal 1 damage per successful step so far.  For example, if a deadly strike is the fourth step of your plan, it would deal 4 damage to your opponent.

A plan that is _1. approach 2. control 3. deadly strike 4. control 5. deadly strike_ would deal 8 damage (3 at step 3 and 5 at step 5).  Of course, this requires five successful steps.  If only the first four steps of your plan are successful, you would deal 3 damage.

If you are feeling more cautious, you could go for a less risky four-step plan: _1. approach 2. strike 3. control 4. deadly strike_, which would deal 5 damage (1 at step 2, and 4 at step 4).

1 point of damage will either:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li>  reduce the target's Integrity by 1 </li>
<li> reduce the target's size by 1 scale </li>
</ul>

For example, a sortie with an Integrity of 4 and a size of 100s that takes 2 points of damage could either

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li> lose 2 Integrity to end up with 2 Integrity and a size of 100s </li>
<li> drop two sizes, to end up with an Integrity of 4 and a size of 1s </li>
<li> lose 1 Integrity and drop 1 size, to end up with an Integrity of 3 and a size of 10s </li>
</ul>

If a unit reaches 0 Integrity of a size of 0, it can be disbanded.
