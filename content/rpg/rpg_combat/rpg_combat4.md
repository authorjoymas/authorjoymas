**Focus, Roll, Reroll**

Just as with other challenges, you'll need to select a focus characteristic that makes sense, roll your dice pool, reroll the lower numbers, and count your successes.

Each success represents a successful step in your plan, in order.

**You can't force success**

Unlike other challenges, in combat you can't force success.  If you only roll three successes for a four-step plan, the last step is left incomplete.

If you roll more successes than you need, the surplus successes are wasted.
