Unfortunately, or fortunately, there are times where the only possible, practical or preferable path to your goal is through combat.  Raiding parties can attack villages, hosts clash on battlefields, armies siege cities, brigands trouble travellers or assassins sneak into royal quarters with poison-tipped daggers - combat is everywhere.

Combat is similar, but not identical, to other challenges:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li>  making a plan </li>
<li> selecting a focus characteristic </li>
<li> rolling a dice pool of your unit's Integrity plus 4 and checking for successes </li>
<li> rerolling the lower numbered dice </li>
<li> dealing damage to your enemy </li>
</ul>

Making a plan in combat involves some very simple, but specific steps.  Once combat is in motion you won't be able to change your plan, so making a plan can be a little like making a gamble.  Note that unlike other challenges, you cannot pick a new focus characteristic on a bad roll or pay your way to success.
