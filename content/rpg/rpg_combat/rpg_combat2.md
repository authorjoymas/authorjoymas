Unfortunately, or fortunately, there are times where the only possible, practical or preferable path to your goal is through combat.  Raiding parties can attack villages, hosts clash on battlefields, armies siege cities, brigands trouble travellers or assassins sneak into royal quarters with poison-tipped daggers - combat is everywhere.

Combat is similar, but not identical, to other challenges:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li>  making a plan </li>
<li> selecting a focus characteristic </li>
<li> rolling and rerolling a dice pool of your unit's Integrity plus 4 and checking for successes </li>
<li> checking for resistance</li>
<li> dealing damage to your enemy </li>
</ul>
