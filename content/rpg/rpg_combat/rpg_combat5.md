**Aftermath**

If you deal a deadly blow in combat - enough to reduce an enemy unit's Integrity to 0 or size to 0 - you can disband the unit, scattering its members to the winds (physical or spiritual) and taking them out of play.

However, if there are no more enemies about, it might be worth questioning the unit.  Instead of immediately disbanding the unit, you can instead roll to explore and ask the unit to provide you with valuable intel.  Once the questioning is over, you can disband the unit.

Alternatively, you can also try to influence the unit.  Instead of dealing the last set of damage, you can leave them with their last bit of Integrity and instead make an influence roll.  If you manage to influence them then you have gained a reluctant but useful temporary ally.  However, if you fail the roll, the unit will go free with its last bt of Integrity left - and they might hold a grudge against you.

Before you meet them again, you might want to think about [crafting](/rpg_crafting.html) some new weapons, or detaching some new units.
