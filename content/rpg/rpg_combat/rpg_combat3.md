**Make a plan**

A combat plan is generally quite simple.  However, it includes a number of steps, each of which is a single manoeuvre.  Overall, the manoeuvres describe an intuitive combat narrative, such as "charging at the enemy, driving them towards a cliff-face, and pushing them off" or "flanking the enemy, trapping them in a pincer, and attacking", or "leaping over a table at the soldier, sweeping his legs from under him, and stabbing him with a dagger".

There are five different types of manoeuvre:

**Approach** - necessary to get close to the enemy when you are not within striking range.  You can narrate the type of approach, such as quick, sneaky, or intimidating.

**Strike** - a hit to the enemy that will remove 1 Integrity

**Control** - a narration of placing the enemy into a difficult position, such as pinning them, trapping them, or restraining them

**Deadly strike** - a strike that does more damage to Integrity than normal, but which can only follow a control manoeuvre

**Retreat** - a manoeuvre to take you out of striking range before you run out of momentum

When you make a plan you'll need to combine some of these manoeuvres together.  A plan can be two, three, four or more steps long - but remember that your roll might cut your plan short.
