**Make a plan**

Provide a brief description to the GM of how your unit is going to engage in combat.

**Focus, Roll, Reroll**

Just as with other challenges, you'll need to select a focus characteristic that makes sense, roll your dice pool, reroll the lower numbers, and count your successes.

Each success represents a successful step in your plan, in order.
