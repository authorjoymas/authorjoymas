**Face resistance**

After you've rolled and rerolled to complete combat, the targeted unit can roll and reroll to put up resistance.  The unit can pick any relevant characteristic as its focus characteristic. On a resistance roll, you cannot force success.

If a resistance roll has more successes than the challenge roll, any deadly strike turns into an ordinary strike.

If a unit's Weakness is the target of a deadly strike, the unit cannot make a resistance roll.
