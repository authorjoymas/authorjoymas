### Pick a characteristic

For a unit to carry out the plan, the player must select a relevant characteristic from the unit's list.  For example, if engaging in combat, the player could pick the _deadly_ characteristic, while if climbing difficult terrain the player could pick the _rugged_ characteristic.  The higher the characteristic is listed on the unit's card, the more likely they are to capably carry out the plan, so different units will specialise in different things.

### Roll the dice

Players then roll dice for the unit, rolling one dice for each Integrity point the unit has.  Once the dice have been rolled, they are placed against each characteristic, with sixes lined up against the top characteristic, fives against the second characteristic, and so forth, until ones are lined up against the last characteristic.

The number of dice assigned to each characteristic indicates the success of that characteristic.  Each dice represents one successful step of the plan.

**Example**

A player might choose to _explore_, using their unit's second characteristic, _knowledge of the land_, and chooses to ask the GM 3 questions about the terrain and its inhabitants.  With an Integrity score of 6 for this unit, they roll 6 dice.  The results are two 6s, two 5s, one 3 and one 1.  Because _knowledge of the land_ is the second characteristic, the player lines up the 5s against the characteristic, meaning that they have two successes.  This allows them to ask the GM two questions and get two honest answers.  Because they didn't get a third 5, they are unable to ask their third question.
