Whenever a player wants to try a difficult, improbable or contentious task, they need to resolve a challenge using dice.

To complete a challenge, the player must state what the unit's **plan** is, then **pick a characteristic** that supports that plan, **roll the dice** to see if the plan is going along successfully, and decide whether to **change plans** as well as **reroll** the dice.  In general, the higher a characteristic is listed for the unit, the greater chance of success they have.

If a unit is asked to perform an action that goes against its motivation, it will cost the unit 1 Integrity.

### Make a plan

Before a unit acts, the player makes a plan for the unit.  Depending on the type of challenge that the unit is attempting, the plan may have one or more stages.  There are four general types of challenge:

_Exporation_, where the player wants to discover something new.  For this challenge, the plan is simply a list of questions that the player wants answered about the scene or the lore.

_Navigation_, where the player wants to move to a new location.  In this case, the player and the GM discuss the terrain and the player decides how to progress over the terrain.  This could involve climbing mountains or fording rivers, sneaking through shadows or scaling walls, or similar.

_Influence_, where players try to learn information from reluctant or guarded individuals, negotiate deals, or motivate others into action.  There are special actions for this type of challenge to establish facts, make arguments and motivate conclusions.

_Combat_, where players use forceful, physical or military approaches to resolve issues.  This challenge also has special actions to approach opponents, gain control of the scene, deliver a killing blow, or take prisoners.
