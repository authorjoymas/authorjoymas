### Re-roll and Change Plans

If the roll hasn't been completely successful, the player has the option to both re-roll and change plans.  A player can re-roll one die from each row beneath the chosen characteristic.  For example, the Traders' Guild delegation might want to sweet-talk their way into an exclusive party.  _Sweet-talking_ is their second-listed characteristic, but the player only rolls a single 5, which isn't enough for them to succeed.  They can now decide to stick with their plan and re-roll the dice, or take a new plan and re-roll the dice.

If they <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>stick with their plan</span>, they can re-roll one die from each row beneath the 5-row - that is, they can re-roll one of the 4s, one of the 2s, and the 1, potentially enabling them to add one, two or three 4s to their original roll and landing them with a success.

If they <span style='color: #d7d5dfff;'>change plans</span>, they need to pick a new characteristic and a new plan - for example, using the two 2s to try and connect with a local contact to let them into the party.  Because their new characteristic is the second-last row, they can only re-roll the 1.
