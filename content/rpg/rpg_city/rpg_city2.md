### Overview

Alnog the coasts and rivers, and in the valleys between mountains, are the prestigious city-states.  At the pinnacle of each is a central walled city which holds the seat of government, the most prominent trading hub, and the nexus of religious order.  The cities can raise armies, engage in diplomacy and trade, and extend their power out across the land.  Each city has a territory occupied by towns, villages, forests and mountains.
