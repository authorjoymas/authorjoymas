### Navigation

Navigation is the task that allows your units to cross difficult terrain, find their way when lost, overcome environmental obstacles, sneak into places unobserved, and reach challenging location, such as climbing up a tower using a rope, pushing a way through a crowd, or fording a river.  To navigate an environment, briefly describe your plan to the GM.

Just like your unit will have a list of characteristics, the environment will have an index card with a list of characteristics, such as _rocky_ or _icy_ or _misty_.  Knowing these characteristics can be very helpful when navigating.

**Focus, Roll, Reroll**

Once you've got a plan, you can go through the steps of selecting a relevant focus characteristic, rolling your dice pool, checking for successes, and then rerolling.  Once you've completed this, you'll have a number of successes.
