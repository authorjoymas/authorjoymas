### Navigation

Navigation is the task that allows your units to cross difficult terrain, find their way when lost, overcome environmental obstacles, sneak into places unobserved, and reach challenging location, such as climbing up a tower using a rope, pushing a way through a crowd, or fording a river.

To navigate a scenario, you'll first need to make a plan.  For example:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >

<li>1 - Tie a rope to the crenellations. 2 - Climb the rope.  3 - Swing through the window.</li>

<li>1 - Cut down tall trees. 2 - Secure the trees as a bridge over the river. 3 - Cross the river.</li>
</ul>

The GM might help you make a plan to account for the environment.

If you are using hexes or any other sort of grid, you can simply assign each grid movement as a step of the plan.

**Focus, Roll, Reroll**

Once you've got a plan, you can go through the steps of selecting a relevant focus characteristic, rolling your dice pool, checking for successes, and then rerolling.  Once you've completed this, you'll have a number of successes.  Each success represents a success for one step of your plan.

**Force success**

If you have enough successes to complete your plan, then you can carry it out without a hitch.

If you don't have enough successes, you have a choice:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li>stop at the last successful step, even if it means you are stuck somewhere</li>
<li>pay 1 Integrity for each remaining step you want to succeed at</li>

<li>ask the GM to give your unit a Weakness in exchange for a successful step</li>
</ul>

If you pick the first option, the GM might describe the situation that your unit ends up in.
