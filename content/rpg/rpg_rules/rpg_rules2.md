Your faction will face a lot of challenges during the game, faced with exploring new areas, navigating difficult terrain, influencing others to come to your aid, engaging in combat, detaching units, crafting equipment, and using innovations like magic or unusual technology.

Each challenge is faced in roughly the same way:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li>  making a plan </li>
<li> selecting a focus characteristic </li>
<li> rolling and rerolling a dice pool of your unit's Integrity plus 4 and checking for successes </li>
<li> checking for resistance </li>
<li> paying Integrity or gaining a Weakness if you want to force success </li>
</ul>

However, different types of challenges have a few special details.

This page will go through the challenges of exploration and navigation.
