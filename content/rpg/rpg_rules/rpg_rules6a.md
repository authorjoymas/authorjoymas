**Check for resistance**

While you rolled for success based on the characteristics of your unit, the GM can now roll for resistance against the characteristics of the environment.

The GM will pick one of the environment's characteristics to make a _resistance roll_, rolling and rerolling a number of dice based on the environment's Integrity and looking for successes based on the focus characteristic.  (If the environment doesn't have a specific Integrity score, the GM can use the characteristic ranking as the Integrity score as well.)

If the number of successes on the resistance roll is higher than the number of successes on the player's roll, the player will fail in their task.

If the GM does not believe that there are any characteristics that would provide resistance, they can simply declare the player's plan a success without anyone needing to roll.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>(!) Face resistance</th>
      </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>If the GM rolls resistance greater than your successes, your challenge will fail.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

**Force success**

If you have enough successes to complete your plan, then you can carry it out without a hitch.

If you don't have enough successes, you have a choice:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li>pay 1 Integrity for each success required to complete the plan</li>

<li>ask the GM to give your unit a Weakness in exchange for a successful step</li>
</ul>

If you pick the second option, the GM might describe the situation that your unit ends up in.
