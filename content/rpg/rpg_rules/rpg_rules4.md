**Select a focus characteristic**

To start the task, select a characteristic from your unit's index card.  The characteristic should have some relevance to the line of questioning.  For example, if you want to learn about mountain spirits, then _knowledge of spirits_ or _mountaineering_ might be relevant characteristics.

Note the number of the characteristic - e.g. if it is the top characteristic it will be numbered 6.

**Roll for success**

Roll a dice pool of your Integrity plus 4.  Look for how many dice show the number of your focus characteristics - these are your successes.

Reroll any dice whose face-value is lower, potentially adding more successes.

**Ask questions**

For each success that you've rolled, you get to ask the GM a question.

If you want to ask a question but don't have enough successes left, there are three strategies you can try:

<ul style="font-size:1.5em; text-align:left; margin-left:4em; color:#F9D695;"; >
<li>pay 1 Integrity to ask another question</li>

<li>ask the GM to give your unit a Weakness to ask another question</li>

<li>ask another question for free, but the GM will roll to determine if the answer is truthful or a lie.  They cannot tell you which.</li>
</ul>
