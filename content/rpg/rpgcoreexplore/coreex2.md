Exploration challenges occur whenever the player wants a unit to find out something new - whether that's charting unknown territory, searching for or learning about the local wildlife or people, testing whether a brew is poisoned, deciphering an ancient text, holding a seance for spirits, or scouting out an enemy army.

To initiate an exploration challenge, a player selects a unit's characteristic that is associated with knowledge, invstigation or perception.  The easiest characteristics to create in relation to exploration challenges are _knowledge of_ characteristics, such as _knowledge of ancient runes_ or _knowledge of wildlife_.  Knowledge can be associated with regions, vocations, cultures, peoples, environments, lore, languages, religions, history, philosophy, spirits or other areas.
