**Combat and Intrigue Exploration**

Players can also explore and discover information in relation to opponent and neutral units in order to prepare for combat or intrigue.  For example, a player may use _scouting_ to scoutenemy forces, or use _espionage_ to discover information about a foreign delegation, either by observing them or searching their room, or use _charm_ to question them.

The challenge is resolved in the same manner as above, except that the player can only access unit information in a limited fashion.  For example, the player may ask, "How many people can I see in the army?" to learn the unit size, or a more open descriptive question ("How have they organised themselves?") to get a desription from the GM that indicates the strength or motivations of the unit.  The GM should limit themselves to indicating just one unit property (size, motivation, weakness, Integrity, etc.) for each question asked.

If the game is played narratively, then the GM should provide descriptive information that can let the player discern the unit properties, whereas if the game is played less narratively the GM can simply state the relevant properties ("Their weakness is that they are slow.").
