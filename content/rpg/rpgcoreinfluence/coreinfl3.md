To complete an influence challenge, the player selects a relevant characteristic and rolls and rerolls the dice.  For each dice assigned to the chosen characteristic, the unit can successfully complete one step of the argument.

If there are enough dice to complete the argument, the player is successful and the unit will be influenced to act in accordance with the player.  If there are not enough dice, the player can either stop the argument at the last successful step, or _take a hit_ for each remaining step and complete the influence challenge successfully.

If the player chooses an argument that fundamentally goes against the target unit's motivations - if they try to appeal to _power_ when their motivation is _humility_, or ask them to betray the monarch when their motivation is _loyalty to the monarch_, the argument will end in failure and the player will take a hit.  Conversely, if the player appeals to the unit's motivation directly, then this step will be automatically successful once it is reached and does not require an assigned die.

If the player chooses a lie for their premise, and if the opposing unit's top characteristic is knowledge or similar that would allow them to see through the lie, then the argument is a failure and the player will take a hit.

**Taking a hit**

When a player takes a hit, the GM either reduces the Integrity of the unit by 1, or adds an additional weakness to the unit.
