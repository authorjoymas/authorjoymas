**Deployable attachments**

Deployable attachments are units _within_ units, such as archers within an army, guards within a city, or individuals within a sortie.

Creating a deployable attachment is virtually identical to creating a detachment, except that the resulting unit stays with the main unit the entire time.  Just as with fixed attachments, if a deployable attachment has a higher Integrity score than the main unit, the main unit does **not** suffer a loss to its Integrity.

Deployable attachments have a size.  If the size is the same as the main unit, the main unit does not suffer a loss of Integrity, because those people are still within the main unit.

Like fixed attachments, a characteristic from a deployable attachment can be used when the main unit is facing a challenge.
