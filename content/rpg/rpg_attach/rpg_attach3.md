**Fixed Attachments**

Fixed attachments represent extra qualities about a unit, such as equipment, temperament, training, philosophy, history, psychology or the like.  They are things that, if the people in the unit disappeared, would either be left on the ground or be rendered completely intangible.

Fixed attachments can't ever be detached to go somewhere on their own, the same way that shields don't go walking off without their owners.

When a player wants to resolve a challenge with a unit, they can draw on either the characteristics of the unit, or the characteristics of an attachment.

You can make new attachments from attachments - for example, one attachment might be dragon-forged military equipment, and a further attachment might be the exact qualities of a sword.

You can also make attachments based on the environment - see [crafting](/rpg_crafting.html) for more detail.  You can work with the GM to make an environment for your faction and craft new attachments when making history.
