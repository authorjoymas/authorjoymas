**Live with the unit, outlive the unit**

Fixed attachments get their own Integrity. If the player resolves a challenge using the attachment, any Integrity losses are borne by both the main unit and the attachment. Thus, if an army is fighting with swords and the swords are damanged, the army is presumed to be damaged as well.

However, if a characteristic from the main unit was used to resolve a challenge, the attachment does not lose Integrity. Ths means that if an army is killed, their swords might remain on the battlefield ready to be looted.

**No size**

Fixed attachments have no size.

In addition, if a fixed attachment is created with more Integrity than the main unit, the main unit does not lose any Integrity as a result.
