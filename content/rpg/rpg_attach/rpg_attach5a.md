**Detaching and re-attaching**

You can detach a deployable unit at any time.  However, if the unit is the same size as the main unit, the main unit will lose 1 Integrity.  Similarly, if the deployable unit has the same size as the main unit, the main unit will suffer a loss of 1 Integrity.

You can also re-attach detachments, turning them into deployable attachments.  If the attaching unit has higher Integrity than the main unit it is attaching to, the main unit gains 1 Integrity.  If the attaching unit is the same size, the main unit gains 1 Integrity.  Bigger units cannot attach to smaller units.
