You've got a culture, a legacy unit, and a bunch of other units - you're almost done.  The last step you can take, if you want, is to flesh out the detail of some of your units by making attachments.  An attachment is an extra index card of possibilities that you associate with a particular unit.

An attachment is a lot like a detachment - you make it in roughly the same way, and you end up with an index card with a title, size (maybe), Motivation, up to six characteristics and some Integrity.  But attachments aren't units that can go off by themselves and have adventures - they are add-ons to your existing units, so they go whre they go, fight when they fight, and disband when they disband (mostly).

There are two types of attachments - those that can detach (let's call them _deployable_) and those that can't (let's call them _fixed_).
