**Live with the unit, die with the unit**

Like fixed attachments, deployable attachments can face challenges for the main unit, and if the challenge results in a loss of Integrity, **both** the attachment and the main unit lose Integrity.  This represents the members of the attachment, who are also members of the unit, dying, giving up or leaving.

However, _unlike_ a fixed attachment, when the main unit suffers a loss of Integrity, the deployable attachment suffers a loss _as well_.

If the deployable unit has more Integrity than the main unit, it can out-survive the main unit.  If the main unit reaches 0 Integrity and is disbanded, the deployable unit will become its own detached unit left behind, such as a group of elite warriors surviving an ambush that killed everyone else.
