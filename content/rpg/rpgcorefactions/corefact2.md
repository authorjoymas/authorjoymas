At the beginning of their first game of _All the Rivers and Mountains_ players will need to build a faction or [choose a faction](/rpgfactions.html) from one of pre-designed factions.  They will stick with this faction the entire game, overseeing towns and armies, creating and commanding new units, and building a legacy.

If creating a new faction there are two steps: making the _legacy unit_, and building a _cultural attachment_.  The legacy unit is the first unit from which other units are created, while the cultural attachment describes factional characteristics that are common to all units in the faction, giving them a sense of unity and cohesion.
