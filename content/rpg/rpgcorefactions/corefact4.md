### Cultural attachment

In addition to creating a legacy unit, players should also create a _cultural attachment_ for their faction, which represents their factional characteristics.  A cultural attachment is similar to any other unit - it contains motivations, a weakness, as well as six descriptive characteristics.  However, the cultural attachment doesn't need to include a size or an Integrity score.

The cultural attachment is automatically attached to _every_ unit in the faction, and can thus be drawn on by any unit during any challenge.  A militant culture might have _citizen combat-training_ as a characteristic, allowing even diplomatic delegations or local villagers to have the chance to complete a successful combat roll.  Most factions should have a cultural attachment that contains some shared knowledge, such as knowledge of the faction's religion, geography, history or language, that might help solve problems, create internal stability or give an advantage when on home turf.
