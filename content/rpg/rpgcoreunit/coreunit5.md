### Weakness

Something that this unit does poorly at or responds poorly to.  This can be created by the player or, at times, can be created by the GM.

Units can gain weaknesses when they are created through the _detachment_ process, or when they perform poorly in a challenge.  While a unit should ideally start with a single, simple weakness, they can gain more weaknesses as the game progresses.

If a unit's weakness is challenged, they are more likely to take damage and lose Integrity.

### Characteristics

Lastly, a unit will have six characteristics defined by the player.  These should be simple and evocative - assassins might be _deadly_ while archers are _ranged_, delgeations might be _charismatic_.

However, players can get as specific as they like, not just to the character of the faction or the unit, but also within the story of the campaign - a unit might have _knowledge of the spirit world_, or a _strong relationship with the priests of Highfield_, or _experience fighting the dread_.

The top characteristic also doubles as the unit's _strength_.  If a unit's strength is challenged, the challenge usually fails.
