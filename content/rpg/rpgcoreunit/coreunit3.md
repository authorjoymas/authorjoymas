### Name

The name of a unit should be indicative of the type of unit that it is, and can vary from straightforward ("a hunting party") to specific ("Poison Thorn Warriors").  As much as possible, the name should allow the players to remember the general character of the unit.

### Integrity

The Integrity score is a number that represents the condition of the unit, whether this be the physical, financial or morale condition.  The higher the number, the better the condition.

If the Integrity score falls to 0, the unit is lost.  You can track integrity using beads or tokens.

### Size

This size represents how many people are in the unit.  Rather than aiming for exact figures, the size should represent the scale of the unit - whether single digits, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, and so on.  Generally units will be at a disadvantage against other units that are of greater size, especially in combat.
