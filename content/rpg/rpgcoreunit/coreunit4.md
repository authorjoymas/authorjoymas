### Motivation

A motivation is what drives your unit onwards.  When units act in accordance with their motivations they will perform well, and when they act against their motivations they will lose morale.  A unit can be tempted by an offer that speaks to their motivation, and will turn down an offer that goes against it.

Motivations can be almost any rationale that players can think of, but some suggestions are:

_Loyalty_ to a place, idea, or people, such as a country, religion, principle or family.

The ambition to achieve _power, wealth_ or _peace_.
