### Inner compound

The compund is bustling and energetic, with many rooms, tunnels, interfaces and the like.

In the centre of the compound is a shielded, crashed alien spacecraft.  When it was found, there was no one on board, and, in fact, no space for any pilot.

Assuming it to be some sort of sophisticated drone, the Primarans stripped it for parts, especially the nanocrystal lattice.
