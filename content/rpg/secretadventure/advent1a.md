## In the beginning...

The Primarans lie toward the inner rim - a populous, confident and technologically advanced peoples who inhabit dozens and perhaps hundreds of planets.

Around you lie scattered the Segundians, Tercians and Quarcers - smaller spacefaring polities who trade and cooperate to survive when necessary.

Now, one of the Tercians has arrived to tell you that the Primarans are invading their small holdings with extremely powerful and unusual weapons that can penetrate thick plating and energy shielding, destroying outposts and obliterating all signs of life without warning.  They ask for your help...

The Quarcers believe that there is an unusual energy signal emanating from the Veridian Range - one that might be an early warning sign of further invasion as well.

And the Segundians have been tracking Primaran fleet movement, noting unusual incursions into Segundian territory without permission.
