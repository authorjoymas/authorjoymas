### Segundian space

Here in Segundian space is an unusual pattern of Primaran traffic, leading to a suspicious location near a black hole, whose accretion disk provides energy and signal interference.  The Primarans seem to be hunting for something.

At the edge of the disk is a large spacecraft with a skeleton crew.
