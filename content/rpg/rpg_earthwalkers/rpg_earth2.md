### Overview

Earthwalkers are a mysterious, ancient folk, who arrive with the mist and cold.  Some say that they crawl out of the clay itself, and no one seems to know whether they are made from the land or perhaps from the dead who are buried there, though mystics say that these are the same thing.

Patient, solid, quiet, the earthwalkers make their way across the world with leaden certainty.
