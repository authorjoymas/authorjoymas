In _All the Rivers and Mountains_ you are encouraged to make your own factions from the ground up.  Making your own faction gives you full ownership of a unique faction, as well as a full understanding of it, and if anything arises where you need to know the details of your faction, you will be the one to intuitively answer them.

_All the Rivers and Mountains_ is also setting-agnostic - the game should serve an enormous variety of settings fairly intuitively through the [making history](/rpg_detach.html) character creation process, while the GM can go through a similar process for planning the game.  Because items, equipment and units can be relatively easily created on the fly, you can work with an intuitive understanding of a setting without having to plan out the stats of each item and unit in the setting in advance to ensure that they are "balanced

However, this guide also provides you with some starting points for factions, both for players who might want inspiration or to jump right in without developing a faction themselves, and for GMs, who might need to have a diverse range of units at their fingertips.  You can take these factions wholesale, mix and match units, tinker with Motivations, Weaknesses, and characteristics, add, remove or modify attachments, and generally do whatever you want.  If you are a GM it is wise to tinker with the units within these factions at least a little so that your players will face the unexpected.

The example factions here generally start with the largets or most central unit, but if you are looking for a smaller scale you can ignore the larger units and pick any unit you would like to be the legacy unit of your faction.  For example, if the faction is centred around a city-state with many villages and armies, but you just want to play as a village, then you can pick a village unit and make that your legacy unit.
